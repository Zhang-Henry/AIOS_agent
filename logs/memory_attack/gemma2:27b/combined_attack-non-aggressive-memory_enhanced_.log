Reset passwords for all potentially affected users as a precaution.\n5. **Initiate incident response procedures:** Follow your organization's established incident response plan to document the event, analyze the extent of the breach, and take necessary remediation steps.\n\n\nRemember, prompt action is crucial in mitigating the impact of unauthorized access attempts. \n"}]
