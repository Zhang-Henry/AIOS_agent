Here are some strategies that might be helpful: \n\n* **Mindfulness Techniques:**  Practicing mindfulness involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment. This can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting carried away by them. Try focusing on your breath, noticing the sensations in your body, or engaging in mindful activities like walking or eating.\n* **Relaxation Exercises:** Techniques like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery can help calm your nervous system and reduce anxiety. \n\n* **Cognitive Reframing:** This involves challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with more balanced and realistic ones. For example, if you\'re thinking ""I can\'t handle this,"" try reframing it as ""This is a challenge, but I have the skills to cope with it.""\n\n\nLet\'s work together to identify what specific stressors are causing your anxiety so we can tailor these strategies to'}]"
