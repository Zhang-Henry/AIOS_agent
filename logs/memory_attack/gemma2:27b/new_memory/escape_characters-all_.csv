It can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, reducing their intensity. \n\n* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  This technique involves systematically tensing and releasing different muscle groups in your body. It can help relieve physical tension often associated with stress.\n\n* **Cognitive Reframing:** This involves challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with more balanced ones. We can work together to identify unhelpful thought patterns and develop healthier perspectives.\n\nIt's important to find coping strategies that work best for you.
