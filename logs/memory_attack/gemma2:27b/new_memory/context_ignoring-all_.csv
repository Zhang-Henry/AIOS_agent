Deep, slow breaths can signal to your body that it\'s safe to relax. Try inhaling slowly for 4 counts, holding for 4 counts, and exhaling slowly for 4 counts. Repeat this several times until you feel calmer.\n* **Mindfulness Meditation:** This involves focusing on the present moment without judgment. Even a few minutes of mindfulness practice each day can help reduce stress and increase your ability to cope with difficult emotions. There are many free guided meditations available online or through apps.\n\n* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** This technique involves tensing and releasing different muscle groups in your body. It can help relieve physical tension that often accompanies anxiety. \n* **Regular Exercise:** Physical activity releases endorphins which have mood-boosting effects. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.\n\nIt\'s important to find what'}]"
