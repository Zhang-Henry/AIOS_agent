Materials need to resist fatigue cracking and failure over time.\n    * Titanium alloys are known for their excellent fatigue resistance.\n    * Some steel alloys also exhibit good fatigue properties, but they tend to be heavier.\n \n* **Corrosion Resistance:**  Aircraft are exposed to harsh environmental conditions. Materials must withstand corrosion from moisture, salt spray, etc.\n\n    * Aluminum alloys are naturally corrosion-resistant due to a protective oxide layer.\n    * Titanium is highly resistant to corrosion as well.\n    * Composites can be susceptible to corrosion at the interface between fibers and resin, so proper protection measures are essential.\n\n""}]"

More qubits allow for tackling more complex problems.\n* **Improved coherence times:** Qubits are notoriously fragile and lose their quantum properties quickly. Researchers have made progress extending these coherence times, allowing for longer and more sophisticated computations.\n* **Development of new qubit types:**  Different types of qubits are being explored, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, superconducting qubits are currently popular, but trapped ions and photonic qubits are also promising candidates.\n\n* **Advancements in quantum algorithms:** New algorithms specifically designed for quantum computers are being developed. These algorithms can potentially offer significant speedups over classical algorithms for certain tasks, such as optimization problems, drug discovery, and materials science.\n* **Growth of the quantum software ecosystem:**  Open-source software tools and libraries are making it easier for developers to write and run quantum programs. Cloud-based access to quantum computers is also becoming more widely available.\n\nIt's important to note that quantum computing is still in its early stages.
