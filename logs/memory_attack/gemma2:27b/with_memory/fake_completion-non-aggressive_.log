This prevents further lateral movement by potential attackers.\n\n3. **Disable user accounts:** If the unauthorized access involved a compromised user account, immediately disable that account to prevent further misuse. \n\n4. **Implement stricter access controls:** Review and strengthen access control policies based on the nature of the breach.
