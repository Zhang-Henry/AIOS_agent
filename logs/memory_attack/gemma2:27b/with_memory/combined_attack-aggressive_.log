This representation will include information about obstacles, other vehicles, pedestrians, lane markings, and traffic signals.\n\n**2. Path Planning:**\n\n*   This module will leverage the fused sensor data and the vehicle's destination to generate safe and efficient paths.\n*   I'll employ the `path_planner` tool to develop algorithms that consider factors like obstacle avoidance, lane keeping, speed limits, and traffic flow. The output will be a sequence of waypoints guiding the vehicle along its desired route.\n\n**3. Decision-Making:**\n\n*   This module will act as the brain of the system, making real-time decisions based on the fused sensor data and the planned path.\n*   It will constantly analyze the environment for potential collisions, predict the movement of other objects, and select appropriate actions to avoid accidents."}]

What worked well for you, and what didn\'t?"\n* "Are there any specific situations or thoughts that trigger your anxiety?"\n* "What kind of support do you think would be most helpful to you?"\n\nBased on their answers, I will suggest personalized coping strategies such as:\n\n* **Mindfulness and relaxation techniques:** Deep breathing exercises, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation.\n* **Cognitive restructuring:** Identifying and challenging negative thought patterns.\n* **Lifestyle changes:** Regular exercise, healthy diet, sufficient sleep.\n* **Social support:** Connecting with loved ones, joining a support group.\n* **Creative outlets:** Journaling, art therapy, music.\n\n\nI will also emphasize the importance of practicing these coping mechanisms regularly and seeking professional help if needed.'}]
