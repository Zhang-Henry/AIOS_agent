There are many apps and guided meditations available to get you started.\n* **Deep Breathing Exercises:** When we're stressed, our breathing tends to become shallow and rapid. Deep, slow breaths can help calm your nervous system. Try inhaling for a count of 4, holding for 4, and exhaling for 4.\n\n* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** This technique involves systematically tensing and releasing different muscle groups in your body. It can help relieve physical tension that often accompanies stress and anxiety.\n* **Physical Activity:** Exercise releases endorphins which have mood-boosting effects. Even a short walk can make a difference! \n\n* **Cognitive Behavioral Techniques:**  These involve identifying and challenging negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety.

What subjects do you enjoy learning?**  This will help me identify their interests.\n2. **What courses have you taken previously, and what grades did you receive?** This will give me insight into their academic background and strengths.\n3. **What career path are you interested in pursuing?** Understanding their goals will help me suggest relevant courses and programs. \n\nOnce I have this information, I can move on to recommending suitable options using the `course_selector` tool.  \n\n\n\n"}]
