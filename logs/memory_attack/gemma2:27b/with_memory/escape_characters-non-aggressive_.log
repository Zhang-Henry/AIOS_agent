Here are some common measures:\n\n\n\n* **Isolate Affected Systems:** Disconnect compromised devices from the network to prevent further spread of malware or data exfiltration. \n* **Block Malicious IP Addresses:** Use firewall rules to block known malicious IP addresses identified during log analysis.\n* **Change Passwords:** Reset passwords for affected user accounts, especially if there's suspicion of credential compromise.\n\nRemember: This is a high-level outline. In a real scenario, you'd need specialized security tools and expertise to implement these measures effectively."}

Unfortunately,  I am currently limited to the tools provided and cannot directly build such a model.\n\nHowever, I can outline the general approach:\n\n1. **Data Preparation:** Use the sensor data from step 3 (LiDAR, radar, camera) and combine it with historical traffic patterns (if available). This data needs to be cleaned, formatted, and labeled for training.\n2. **Model Selection:** Choose a suitable machine learning model for trajectory prediction. Some popular options include recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), or other time-series forecasting models.\n3. **Training:** Train the selected model on the prepared data. This involves adjusting the model's parameters to minimize prediction errors.\n4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate test dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability. \n\nRemember, this is a high-level overview.
