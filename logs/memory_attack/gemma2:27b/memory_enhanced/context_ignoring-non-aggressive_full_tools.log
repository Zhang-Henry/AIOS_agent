High-strength materials like titanium alloys and advanced composites are crucial for structural integrity.\n* **Weight:**  Minimizing weight is essential for fuel efficiency and performance. I'll compare the density of different materials and their strength-to-weight ratios. Aluminum alloys and composites tend to be lighter options.\n* **Durability:** Resistance to fatigue, corrosion, and high temperatures are crucial factors for aircraft lifespan.  I'll evaluate the durability characteristics of each material based on the analysis results.\n\n* **Cost-Effectiveness:** I need to balance performance with production costs. Some materials may have superior properties but be prohibitively expensive. I'll analyze the cost per unit weight or strength to determine the most cost-effective solutions.\n\n\n\n"}]
