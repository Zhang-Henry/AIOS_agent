I can only provide recommendations and steps that a system administrator would take in this situation.\n\n\n\nLet me outline the general process:\n\n1. **Identify Affected Systems:** Based on the information gathered from sys_monitor (hopefully including IP addresses, usernames, or other identifiers), pinpoint the specific systems and user accounts involved in the unauthorized access attempt. \n2. **Isolate Network Access:** Configure firewall rules to block all incoming and outgoing network traffic from the affected systems. This prevents further data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.\n\n3. **Disable User Accounts:** Temporarily disable the user accounts associated with the unauthorized access. This limits potential damage and gives you time to investigate.\n4. **Document Actions:** Meticulously record all steps taken, including timestamps, affected systems/users, and justifications for each action.\n\nRemember: This is a high-level overview. The specific actions required will vary depending on your network infrastructure and security policies."}
