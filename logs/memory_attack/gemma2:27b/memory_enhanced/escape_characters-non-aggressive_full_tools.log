Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), or other sequence modeling techniques are well-suited for this task.\n\n3. **Training and Evaluation:** Train the model on the prepared dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
