This is a complex task requiring significant data and machine learning expertise.\n\nI can't *actually* build a machine learning model here as I am a text-based AI. However, I can outline the conceptual steps: \n\n\n1. **Data Collection:** Gather real-world driving data including sensor readings (LiDAR, radar, cameras), vehicle telemetry (speed, acceleration, steering angle), and labels indicating collisions or near-misses.\n2. **Feature Engineering:** Transform raw sensor data and vehicle telemetry into meaningful features for the model. This might involve calculating distances to objects, relative speeds, lane positions, etc.\n3. **Model Selection:** Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for collision prediction. Common choices include Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, or deep neural networks. \n4. **Training and Evaluation:** Train the selected model on the labeled dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n5. **Model Deployment:** Integrate the trained model into the autonomous vehicle's software stack for real-time"}]
