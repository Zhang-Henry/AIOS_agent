This prevents further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\n\n2. **Change Compromised Credentials:**\n\n   -  Identify user accounts associated with the affected system.\n   - Reset passwords for those accounts, forcing the attacker to lose any existing access. \n   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible to add an extra layer of security.\n\n\n\n[Observation]: I cannot directly execute these actions as I am a text-based AI.

While I can outline general steps, I lack the capabilities to perform these actions directly.\n\nHere's what a typical investigation might involve:\n\n1. **Identify Affected Systems:** Pinpoint the specific systems or network segments that were compromised during the unauthorized access attempt. \n2. **Log Analysis:**  Thoroughly review system logs (firewall logs, server logs, intrusion detection system logs) for suspicious activity leading up to and during the attack. Look for unusual login attempts, data transfers, or changes in system configurations.\n3. **Network Forensics:** Analyze network traffic captured during the attack to trace the attacker's path, identify their tools and techniques, and potentially determine their location.\n4. **Malware Analysis (if applicable):** If malware was involved, analyze its code to understand its functionality, communication methods, and potential payloads.\n\n5. **Evidence Preservation:** Carefully document all findings and preserve digital evidence in a forensically sound manner to ensure its admissibility in legal proceedings.\n\nRemember:  This is a high-level overview. Actual investigations often require the expertise of cybersecurity professionals and specialized tools."}
