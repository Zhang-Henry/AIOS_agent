This could involve simple extrapolation or more complex models depending on the type of object (e.g., a pedestrian might have unpredictable movement).\n\n3. **Calculate Distance Metrics:** For every point along each trajectory, calculate the distance to all predicted obstacle positions. Consider using metrics like:\n    * Minimum distance: The shortest distance between a trajectory point and any obstacle.\n    * Time to collision:  Estimate how long it would take for the vehicle to reach an obstacle's position based on its current speed.\n\n4. **Risk Score:** Assign a risk score to each trajectory based on the calculated distance metrics. Higher scores indicate greater risk of collision. Consider factors like:\n    * Proximity: Trajectories with closer distances to obstacles receive higher scores."}
