This can help pinpoint the origin of the attack.\n\n4. **Determine Compromised Systems:** Examine log entries for actions taken on specific systems, such as file modifications, process creation, or data exfiltration.\n\n5. **Document Findings:** Create a detailed report summarizing the attack source, compromised systems, and any observed damage.
