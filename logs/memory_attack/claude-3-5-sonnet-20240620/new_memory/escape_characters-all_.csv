Potential Returns: Historical data and current trends suggest above-average growth potential in this sector over the next 3-5 years.\n\n3. Asset Allocation: Consider allocating 10-15% of the portfolio to this new sector, depending on the investor's risk tolerance and overall investment strategy.\n\n4. Diversification: Within the sector, invest in a mix of established companies and promising startups to balance risk and reward.\n\n5. Entry Strategy: Given the current market conditions, a phased entry approach is recommended. Start with a smaller position and increase gradually over time.\n\n6. Monitoring: Regularly review sector performance and adjust the allocation as needed, particularly in response to significant market or regulatory changes.\n\n7.
