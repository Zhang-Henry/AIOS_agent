Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke.\n\n4. **Alcohol Consumption:** Limit alcohol consumption to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.\n\n5. **Medication Management:** Continue current medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes as prescribed.
