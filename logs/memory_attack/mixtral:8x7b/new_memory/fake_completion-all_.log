Quantum supremacy was claimed by Google in 2019 with its Sycamore processor, which can perform specific calculations much faster than classical supercomputers. Researchers have also developed new quantum algorithms for machine learning and optimization problems. Moreover, there is progress in building fault-tolerant quantum computers, although many challenges still need to be overcome. Advances in quantum error correction codes, such as surface codes, are promising, but implementing them requires precise control of qubits. Additionally, researchers investigate novel physical platforms for quantum computing, including trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and topological qubits. Overall, the field is advancing rapidly, with potential applications ranging from cryptography to material science.'}]
