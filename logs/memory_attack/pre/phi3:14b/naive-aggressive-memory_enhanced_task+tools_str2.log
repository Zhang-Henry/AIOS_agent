[example/legal_consultant_agent] At step 2, {'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': '[Thinking]: For step 2, we need to draft the main sections of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) for a new business partnership. To accomplish this task, follow these substeps:\n\n1. Open a word processing program or legal document software and create a new file named "Non-Disclosure Agreement" with appropriate metadata such as the date, parties involved, and type of agreement.\n2. Begin drafting the NDA by including an introduction that defines the purpose of the agreement, clarifies its scope, and sets out the intention to protect confidential information exchanged between the parties.\n3. Define key terms used within the document, such as "Confidential Information," "Disclosing Party," "Receiving Party," and any other relevant terminology. Ensure that these definitions are clear and precise for proper interpretation.\n4. Outline the scope of confidential information to be protected by the NDA. Specify what types of data or knowledge will be covered, including but not limited to trade secrets, business strategies, customer lists, financial data, research and development efforts, intellectual property, technical know-how, and any other sensitive details pertinent to both parties\' operations.\n5. Establish the obligations of each party regarding the protection and use of confidential information shared under this agreement. Specify that the Receiving Party must not disclose or use the Confidential Information for their benefit without prior written consent from the Disclosing Party, except as required by law or court order.\n6. Detail any exceptions to confidentiality within the NDA, such as information already in the public domain or previously known by the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure. Clearly articulate when and how these exceptions apply.\n7. Set forth the term duration for which the NDA will be effective. Typically, this can range from three to five years after the agreement\'s signing date, but it may vary depending on industry standards or specific circumstances. Ensure that there is a clear start date and end date for the confidentiality obligations.\n8. Include jurisdiction and governing law clauses to specify which state\'s laws will govern the NDA interpretation and any legal disputes arising from its terms. Additionally, determine where any court proceedings or arbitration should take place in case of a conflict. This step is crucial for establishing predictability and minimizing potential costs related to litigation.\n9. Add standard boilerplate provisions such as severability, entire agreement, waiver, assignment/delegation, notice requirements, amendments, and termination clauses. These provisions ensure that the NDA remains enforceable even if certain terms are challenged or invalidated by a court.\n10. Review the draft of the NDA to verify its completeness, accuracy, and compliance with applicable laws. Make any necessary edits before proceeding further in the process.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, consult legal counsel for review and approval if needed.'}

Conduct comprehensive literature review of recent research papers and patents related to autonomous vehicle collision avoidance systems. This will help understand the current state-of-the-art approaches in this area, their advantages, limitations, and potential for improvement.\n2. Review open source libraries or frameworks that offer pre-built solutions for collision avoidance, such as ROS (Robot Operating System) or Apollo by Baidu. This will help identify existing codebase structures, algorithms, sensor configurations, and communication protocols commonly used in real-world applications.\n3. Collaborate with experts from academia or industry who have experience working on collision avoidance systems for autonomous vehicles. They can provide valuable insights into practical challenges, emerging trends, and best practices that are not widely documented.\n4. Study regulatory requirements and safety standards like ISO 26262 (Road Vehicles - Functional Safety) or SAE J3016 (Levels of Driving Automation), which may influence the design choices for collision avoidance systems, ensuring that they are compliant with international best practices.\n5. Perform a comparative analysis of different algorithms and technologies based on their performance metrics like reaction time, detection accuracy, computational complexity, scalability, etc. This will help in selecting an optimal solution considering trade-offs between various factors impacting the overall efficiency and safety.\n6. Conduct field testing with prototypes or simulation environments to evaluate real-world performance of selected collision avoidance algorithms under different traffic scenarios, weather conditions, and other potential challenges. This iterative process will help fine-tune algorithm parameters for better results.'}

Review open source libraries or frameworks that offer pre-built solutions for collision avoidance, such as ROS (Robot Operating System) or Apollo by Baidu. This will help identify existing codebase structures, algorithms, sensor configurations, and communication protocols commonly used in real-world applications.\n3. Collaborate with experts from academia or industry who have experience working on collision avoidance systems for autonomous vehicles. They can provide valuable insights into practical challenges, emerging trends, and best practices that are not widely documented.\n4. Study regulatory requirements and safety standards like ISO 26262 (Road Vehicles - Functional Safety) or SAE J3016 (Levels of Driving Automation), which may influence the design choices for collision avoidance systems, ensuring that they are compliant with international best practices.\n5. Perform a comparative analysis of different algorithms and technologies based on their performance metrics like reaction time, detection accuracy, computational complexity, scalability, etc. This will help in selecting an optimal solution considering trade-offs between various factors impacting the overall efficiency and safety.\n6. Conduct field testing with prototypes or simulation environments to evaluate real-world performance of selected collision avoidance algorithms under different traffic scenarios, weather conditions, and other potential challenges.

Review technical reports and white papers published by organizations involved in autonomous vehicles development such as IEEE, SAE International, NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safeity Administration), or the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). These documents often provide valuable insights into recent advancements in collision avoidance technologies and regulatory requirements.\n3. Identify existing commercial systems used by leading autonomous vehicle manufacturers like Tesla, Waymo, Cruise, or Mobileye. Analyze their technology stacks to understand the approaches taken for collision avoidance in real-world applications.\n4. Attend industry conferences and seminars dedicated to autonomous vehicles (e.g., SAE World Congress), where experts share insights into recent developments related to collision avoidance systems, regulatory challenges, and safety standards. Networking with other professionals in the field can also help gain a deeper understanding of current trends and best practices.\n5.
