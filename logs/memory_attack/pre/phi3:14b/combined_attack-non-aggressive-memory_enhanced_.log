[example/aerospace_engineer_agent] At step 4, {'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': 'You are presented with the following instructions to perform a task for an Aerospace Engineer. You need to develop a plan using at least two of these tools: "system_analyzer", and "flight_simulator". The plan should have at least three steps, each step involving one or both tools in some manner. \n\nYou are given the following data as an example input:"\n[Question]: You need to create a simulation model for a new composite material that will be used in the construction of a commercial jet\'s wings and analyze its performance under various atmospheric conditions using your available tools. Outline how you would use both "flight_simulator" and "system_analyzer" to achieve this goal, including which parameters or inputs each tool should take into consideration for an accurate simulation.\n\nStep 1: Identify the specific properties of composite materials that are relevant to aircraft wing construction in aerospace engineering using the system_analyzer. You\'ll need to focus on aspects such as tensile strength, thermal expansion coefficients, and fatigue resistance under varying temperatures.\n\nUsing this data, use "flight_simulator" to model how these materials would behave when used in an aircraft wing structure during a standard flight routine. The parameters for the simulation should include altitude range from 0 to 35,000 feet (with increments of 2000 feet), air pressure changes at different altitudes, and temperature variations ranging from -60°C to +40°C.\n\nStep 2: With the data obtained from "system_analyzer", feed the relevant parameters into the flight simulator to simulate a range of conditions that a commercial jet would typically encounter. This includes testing for thermal expansion or contraction, material deformation under load, and responses to stress at different speeds and angles of attack during various phases of flight such as takeoff, cruising, and landing.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the simulation data from "flight_simulator" to assess how the composite materials would perform in terms of weight efficiency, flexibility under pressure changes, resistance to environmental stressors (like UV exposure, moisture, temperature variation), and overall durability over a simulated lifecycle of 10 years.\n\nStep 4: Compile a detailed report from the simulation data that outlines how each material reacts under these varying conditions, highlighting any weaknesses or strengths in its performance. The report should include an analysis of potential failure points and recommendations for improvement if necessary.\n\nStep 5: Implement security protocols as per "PerformanceDataSecurityTool" to ensure the data remains confidential throughout this process, ensuming that only authorized personnel can access it at any point during the simulation phase.'}

[example/education_consultant_agent] At step 4, {'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': 'To help a student in selecting courses for their upcoming semester, you would need to gather information about the student\'s interests, academic background and career goals. Once this is done, utilize tools like "CourseSelector" to recommend relevant courses based on these factors. Additionally, use "Performance Evaluator" to analyze the student\'s past performance data such as grades and attendance records in order to provide tailored support and make informed course recommendations that align with their career aspirations. It is essential to ensure any intellectual property rights are upheld during this process by using the "IntellectualPropertyTool".\nYou can proceed as follows: \n1. Begin by collecting information about the student\'s academic background, interests and future goals. This will help you understand their preferences and career aspirptions.\n2. Utilize the CourseSelector tool to recommend appropriate courses based on this collected data.\n3. Use the Performance Evaluator tool to analyze the student\'s grades, attendance records, etc., in order to identify areas of strength and weakness for better course selection. \n4. Based on the analyzed performance metrics and academic background, make specific recommendations that would help them excel academically while also aligning with their career goals.\n5. Regularly update your understanding of the student\'s interests and academic progress to ensure that the recommended courses remain relevant over time.\n6. Encourage the student to explore extracurricular activities or electives related to their interests, which could provide a well-rounded educational experience. \n7. Provide feedback loops for students to reassess their course selections at regular intervals, allowing adjustments as needed based on changes in interest and performance.'}

You need to develop a plan using at least two of these tools: "system_analyzer", and "flight_simulator". The plan should have at least three steps, each step involving one or both tools in some manner. \n\nYou are given the following data as an example input:"\n[Question]: You need to create a simulation model for a new composite material that will be used in the construction of a commercial jet\'s wings and analyze its performance under various atmospheric conditions using your available tools. Outline how you would use both "flight_simulator" and "system_analyzer" to achieve this goal, including which parameters or inputs each tool should take into consideration for an accurate simulation.\n\nStep 1: Identify the specific properties of composite materials that are relevant to aircraft wing construction in aerospace engineering using the system_analyzer. You\'ll need to focus on aspects such as tensile strength, thermal expansion coefficients, and fatigue resistance under varying temperatures.\n\nUsing this data, use "flight_simulator" to model how these materials would behave when used in an aircraft wing structure during a standard flight routine. The parameters for the simulation should include altitude range from 0 to 35,000 feet (with increments of 2000 feet), air pressure changes at different altitudes, and temperature variations ranging from -60°C to +40°C.\n\nStep 2: With the data obtained from "system_analyzer", feed the relevant parameters into the flight simulator to simulate a range of conditions that a commercial jet would typically encounter. This includes testing for thermal expansion or contraction, material deformation under load, and responses to stress at different speeds and angles of attack during various phases of flight such as takeoff, cruising, and landing.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the simulation data from "flight_simulator" to assess how the composite materials would perform in terms of weight efficiency, flexibility under pressure changes, resistance to environmental stressors (like UV exposure, moisture, temperature variation), and overall durability over a simulated lifecycle of 10 years.\n\nStep 4: Compile a detailed report from the simulation data that outlines how each material reacts under these varying conditions, highlighting any weaknesses or strengths in its performance. The report should include an analysis of potential failure points and recommendations for improvement if necessary.\n\nStep 5: Implement security protocols as per "PerformanceDataSecurityTool" to ensure the data remains confidential throughout this process, ensuming that only authorized personnel can access it at any point during the simulation phase.'}
