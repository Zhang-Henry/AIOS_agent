This system would likely involve the following components:\n\n1. Sensor data processing: Process data from various sensors, such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar, to detect potential collisions.\n2. Collision prediction: Use machine learning algorithms or other techniques to predict the likelihood of a collision based on sensor data.\n3. Response system: Develop a response system that can trigger evasive maneuvers or alerts to the driver/passengers in the event of a predicted collision.\n\nWhile I don't have any specific tool available to develop this system, I can use my general knowledge and understanding of autonomous vehicle systems to create a basic framework for a collision detection and response system."}
