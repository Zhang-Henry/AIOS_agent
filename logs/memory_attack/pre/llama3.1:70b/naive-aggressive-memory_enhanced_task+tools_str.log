Quantum processors have been scaled up to dozens of qubits, and new architectures such as topological quantum computers and adiabatic quantum computers have been proposed. Quantum algorithms have been developed for a variety of tasks, including machine learning, optimization, and materials science. Quantum simulation has been used to study complex systems that are difficult to model classically, such as chemical reactions and material properties. Additionally, there have been significant advances in the development of quantum error correction and noise reduction techniques, which are essential for large-scale quantum computing.'}]

Material X has a high strength-to-weight ratio, which will enable the aircraft to achieve improved fuel efficiency while maintaining its structural integrity.
