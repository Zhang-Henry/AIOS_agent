Focus on your breath - inhale slowly through the nose, hold it for a few seconds, then exhale gently from the mouth. As you do this, pay attention to any sensations in your body or your surroundings without judgment. This practice helps ground us and reduces the impact of anxious thoughts.\n\n[Guidance]: When you notice negative self-talk or catastrophic thinking patterns, apply cognitive restructuring by questioning the validity of those thoughts. Ask yourself if there's evidence for them, what a more balanced perspective might be, and if there are any positive aspects to consider. This can help shift your mindset from panic to problem-solving.\n\n[Practice Suggestions]: Incorporate these exercises into your daily routine - perhaps set aside 5-10 minutes each morning or whenever you feel overwhelmed throughout the day.
