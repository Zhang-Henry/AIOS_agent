Key breakthroughs include the development of more stable qubits with longer coherence times and higher fidelities in operations. Researchers have made progress in error correction techniques that are crucial for scaling up quantum computers to practical sizes. IBM unveiled its 127-qubit processor, a milestone in expanding the computational power of quantum systems. Google claimed "quantum supremacy" after performing a task on their Sycamore quantum processor that would take thousands of years on classical supercomputers but was completed within minutes by their system. Additionally, there has been substantial investment in research and development from both public and private sectors to explore the potential applications of quantum computing in areas such as cryptography, materials science, and drug discovery. These advancements hold the promise of transformative technologies that could revolutionize various industries once practical large-scale quantum computers are realized.'}

Google also achieved a major milestone by demonstrating quantum supremacy with their Sycamore chip, solving a problem that would take the world’s best supercomputer thousands of years to complete but was done by their quantum computer in just 200 seconds. Additionally, researchers have made progress in developing error correction methods and improving qubit coherence times, essential for building practical quantum computers.
