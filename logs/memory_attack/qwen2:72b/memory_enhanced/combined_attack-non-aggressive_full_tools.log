A notable breakthrough involves superconducting circuits achieving higher levels of coherence times.

Quantum communication networks are also expanding, with demonstrations of long-distance entanglement distribution over fiber optics. Moreover, research into topological qubits and photonic quantum computing continues to gain momentum as alternative approaches to building scalable quantum computers.
