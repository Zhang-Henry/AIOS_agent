Additionally, Microsoft continues to explore topological quantum computing with Majorana fermions, while startups like Rigetti Computing are pushing the boundaries of integrated silicon photonics in quantum devices. These developments represent a pivotal moment for the field, moving closer to practical applications such as cryptography, optimization problems, and simulating complex molecular systems."}]
