Recent research has shown that quantum computers can potentially solve problems much faster than classical computers. For example, a team of researchers used a quantum algorithm to speed up the solution of linear equations by several orders of magnitude. Quantum cryptography, which uses the principles of quantum mechanics to secure communication channels, has also made significant progress in recent years. Researchers have demonstrated secure key distribution using quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols over distances of more than 100 kilometers. In addition, there has been a growing interest in developing hybrid classical-quantum algorithms that can run on both classical and quantum computers simultaneously. These algorithms are designed to take advantage of the strengths of both types of machines, allowing for faster solution times and improved performance overall. Finally, significant progress has been made in building physical qubits using various technologies such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and semiconductor quantum dots.
