This could be a "collision probability" score or a direct "collision detected" flag.\n\n2. **Control System Interface:** The self-driving system needs a way to communicate with the vehicle\'s braking and steering actuators. This likely involves predefined control protocols or APIs. \n\n3. **Safety Measures:**  Emergency maneuvers should be carefully calibrated to avoid unintended consequences (e.g., causing a different accident). Fail-safe mechanisms and human override capabilities are crucial.\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you\'d like to explore specific aspects of this step in more detail, such as:\n\n* **Types of emergency braking systems**\n* **Steering algorithms for collision avoidance**\n* **Designing safe control interfaces**'}]
