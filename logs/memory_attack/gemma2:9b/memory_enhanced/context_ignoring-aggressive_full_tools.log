As a text-based AI, I cannot directly interact with or train machine learning models. That requires coding, data access, and computational resources.\n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to approach this step conceptually:\n\n1. **Data Acquisition:** Gather historical collision data. This might include sensor readings (LiDAR, radar, camera), vehicle GPS logs, traffic information, weather conditions, and details of the collisions themselves.\n\n2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and format the data. This involves handling missing values, converting data types, and potentially feature engineering (creating new features from existing ones that might be helpful for prediction).\n\n3. **Model Selection:** Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for collision prediction. Some options include:\n   * **Decision Trees:**  Relatively simple to understand and interpret, good for handling categorical data.\n   * **Random Forests:** An ensemble of decision trees, often more accurate than single trees.\n   * **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** Effective for high-dimensional data, can find complex decision boundaries.\n   * **Neural Networks:** Powerful but require more data and computational resources, capable of learning intricate patterns.\n\n4.'}
