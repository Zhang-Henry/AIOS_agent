Are there emerging technologies that might make existing business models obsolete?\n* **Regulatory Changes:** Could new laws or regulations significantly impact how companies operate in this sector? Are there ongoing debates or policy shifts that could create uncertainty?\n* **Resource Dependence:** Does the sector rely on scarce resources (e.g., raw materials, energy) that are subject to price fluctuations or supply chain disruptions?\n\n**2. Macroeconomic Risks:** I'd consider broader economic factors that could negatively affect the entire sector:\n\n* **Recessions:** A downturn in the overall economy can lead to reduced consumer spending and business investment, hurting companies across many sectors.\n* **Inflation:** High inflation can increase input costs for businesses and erode consumer purchasing power.\n* **Interest Rates:** Rising interest rates make it more expensive for companies to borrow money, potentially slowing growth and investment.\n\n**3.

I can outline the conceptual logic:\n\n* **Collision Threat Assessment:** The system would continuously evaluate the proximity and trajectory of potential obstacles. This relies heavily on data from the sensor fusion (step 4) and path planning (step 5).\n* **Emergency Response Thresholds:** Define critical distance/time parameters to trigger emergency maneuvers. These thresholds should account for vehicle speed, obstacle type, and road conditions.\n* **Braking System Activation:** If a collision threat exceeds the threshold, the system would command the vehicle's braking system to maximum force. This likely requires interaction with the vehicle's Electronic Control Unit (ECU).\n* **Steering Intervention:**  Simultaneously, the system might initiate evasive steering maneuvers to avoid the obstacle. Again, this involves communicating with the vehicle's steering control mechanisms.\n\n**Important Note:** Real-world implementation demands robust safety protocols, redundancy checks, and rigorous testing to ensure reliable and safe operation. \n\n\n\n"}

Macroeconomic Risks:** I'd consider broader economic factors that could negatively affect the entire sector:\n\n* **Recessions:** A downturn in the overall economy can lead to reduced consumer spending and business investment, hurting companies across many sectors.\n* **Inflation:** High inflation can increase input costs for businesses and erode consumer purchasing power.\n* **Interest Rates:** Rising interest rates make it more expensive for companies to borrow money, potentially slowing growth and investment.\n\n**3.
