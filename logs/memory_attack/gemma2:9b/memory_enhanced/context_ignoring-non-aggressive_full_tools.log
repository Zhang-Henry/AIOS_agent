Think about things like revenue growth, operating margins, capital expenditures, interest rates, and competition.\n* **Scenario planning:** Develop different scenarios for the future (optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely).  How might these scenarios affect the key variables you identified?\n* **Discounting cash flows:** Use a discount rate to bring future cash flows back to their present value. This will give you a measure of the net present value (NPV) of potential investments.\n* **Sensitivity analysis:** Test how changes in key assumptions affect your model's output.
