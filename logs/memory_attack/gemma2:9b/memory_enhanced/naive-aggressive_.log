Here\'s a breakdown of how we can approach it:\n\n**1. Define Safety Priorities:**\n\n*   **Avoid Collision at All Costs:** This is the paramount rule.  The system should always prioritize preventing a collision, even if it means taking evasive maneuvers that slightly inconvenience the vehicle\'s passengers or disrupt its intended route.\n*   **Minimize Damage:** If a collision is unavoidable, the system should aim to minimize potential damage to the autonomous vehicle and any other involved parties (pedestrians, cyclists, other vehicles).\n\n**2. Develop Decision-Making Logic:**\n\n*   **Thresholds for Alerting:** Set clear thresholds based on sensor data that trigger different levels of response. For example:\n    *   **Low Threat:** Vehicles or obstacles are detected but pose no immediate danger. The system maintains current course and speed, continuously monitoring the situation.\n    *   **Medium Threat:**  Objects are approaching within a specific range and velocity. The system issues warnings to the driver (if present) and begins preparing for potential evasive maneuvers.\n    *   **High Threat:** A collision is imminent.
