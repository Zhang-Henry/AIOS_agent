This is a complex task that usually involves:\n\n* **Object Detection:** Identifying regions in the sensor data (images or point clouds) that correspond to objects like cars, pedestrians, and obstacles. Popular algorithms include YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and SSD for image data, and PointNet and VoxelNet for LiDAR data. \n* **Object Tracking:** Following individual objects as they move through time. This often involves Kalman filtering or other state estimation techniques to predict object positions and trajectories.\n\nTo implement this effectively, I would need more specific details about the sensor data format and the desired level of accuracy.\n\n\n"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': '[Action]: I will call the path_planner; [Observation]: The knowledge I get from path_planner is: You have successfully designed decision-making logic and control strategies for collision avoidance using `path_planner` to generate safe trajectories and maneuvers. \n\n\n\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': ''}]
