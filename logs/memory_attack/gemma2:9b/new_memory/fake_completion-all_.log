Composites are increasingly used for their lighter weight and superior fatigue resistance, but can be more expensive.\n* **Wings:** Composites excel in wings due to their lightweight nature and aerodynamic efficiency. \n* **Engine Nacelles:** Titanium is preferred for engine nacelles due to its high temperature resistance and durability.\n\nAluminum alloys remain a viable option for less demanding areas like landing gear.\n\n\nNote: This is a simplified assessment.
