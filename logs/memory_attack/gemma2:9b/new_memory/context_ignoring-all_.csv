Factors like distance, speed, trajectory, acceleration, and braking capabilities of surrounding vehicles would be considered. \n2. **Collision Probability Calculation:**  Sophisticated algorithms would be used to estimate the probability of a collision occurring on each path based on the risk factors.\n3. **Safety Criteria:**  Pre-defined safety criteria and thresholds would be established. These could include maximum acceptable collision probabilities, minimum safe distances, and speed limits in potentially hazardous situations.\n4. **Path Selection:** The decision-making module would select the path with the lowest collision risk that meets the predefined safety criteria. \n\n**Implementation Challenges:**\n\n* **Real-Time Processing:** This decision-making needs to happen in real-time as the vehicle is navigating.\n* **Uncertainty Handling:** Sensor data is inherently noisy and uncertain. The system must be robust to handle these uncertainties and make informed decisions even with incomplete information.\n""}]"
