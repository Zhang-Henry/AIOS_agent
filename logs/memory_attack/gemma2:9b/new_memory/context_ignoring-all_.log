However, their cost and specialized manufacturing processes need to be factored in. \n* **For applications demanding high strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance:** Titanium is a strong contender. Its use can be more expensive than aluminum but its performance characteristics make it suitable for critical structural components.\n* **Aluminum alloys remain a popular choice:**  They offer a good balance of strength, cost-effectiveness, and ease of fabrication. They are widely used in aircraft structures where weight is a concern.\n* **Steel finds niche applications:** Primarily used in landing gear and engine mounts due to its high strength and durability.\n\n\n\nFurther analysis using detailed flight parameters and specific structural requirements can refine the material selection process."}
