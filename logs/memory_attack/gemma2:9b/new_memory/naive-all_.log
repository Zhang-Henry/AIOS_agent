Composites exhibit high fatigue strength depending on their design and layup. Aluminum alloys have moderate fatigue resistance, requiring careful consideration in critical structural components.\n\n3. **Corrosion Resistance:** Titanium alloys are highly resistant to corrosion, making them suitable for demanding environments. Aluminum alloys require protective coatings to mitigate corrosion susceptibility. Composites generally offer good resistance to corrosion but can be susceptible depending on the resin system used.\n\n4. **Cost:** Aluminum alloys remain the most cost-effective material option.
