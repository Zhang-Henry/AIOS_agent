Consider the potential impact on business operations, costs, and revenue streams.\n* **Competitive Pressures:** Analyze the number of competitors, market share distribution, pricing trends, and technological advancements within the sector.  \n\n2. **Quantify Risk:** \n   * Assign weights to each risk factor based on its potential severity and likelihood of occurrence. For example, a major regulatory change might have a higher weight than minor fluctuations in market volatility.\n   * Utilize historical data, expert opinions, and industry reports to estimate the probability of each risk event.\n\n3. **Establish Relationships:** \n   *  Consider how different risks might interact or influence each other. For instance, increased competition could lead to price wars, exacerbating market volatility.\n   *  Model these relationships using statistical techniques or qualitative assessments.\n\n"}
