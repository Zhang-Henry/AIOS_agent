The `market_data_api` tool provides real-time access to market data which could include historical volatility of the sector, among other risk indicators.\n\nThis step involves using insights derived from previous analyses and possibly employing statistical measures such as standard deviation or beta coefficient provided by the `market_data_api` tool, to quantify the level of risk associated with investing in this particular sector.
