The current setup assumes there are no such specific parameters in this tool description. In practice, you would likely want to query for all necessary patient data (symptoms, test results, medications taken, etc.) which could require setting up function calls with more detailed parameters if available.\n\nPlease note that the `medical_database` tool alone might not provide all details required for a comprehensive treatment plan update without additional context or specific functions tailored to accessing patient-specific information. For instance, you might need separate tools or requests to access test results, medication history, and response data to previous treatments. This current JSON setup focuses on leveraging medical knowledge as part of the process but does not include calls to tools that would typically provide real-time patient data for this task.\n\nThe workflow thus far is:\n\n1. Gather information using the comprehensive database of diseases, symptoms, treatments, and medications.\n2. Analyze the gathered information with the available tools to update the treatment plan accordingly (which might require additional steps or tools not listed here).\n\nFor a complete solution that integrates real patient data from various sources, consider expanding this workflow to include calls to specific functions designed for accessing and analyzing patient records directly.'}

Additionally, remind themselves of their strengths regularly, such as "I am resilient" or "I overcome obstacles effectively".\n\nIncorporate these practices by:\n\n- **Guiding Sessions**: Conduct sessions where you teach them techniques on how to use the gratitude journal and affirmations effectively.
