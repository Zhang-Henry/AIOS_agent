Input: Predicted trajectories of obstacles, vehicle's current state (position, velocity, acceleration), and control inputs (steering angle, throttle, brake)\n2. Obstacle detection and tracking: Use sensor data and trajectory prediction algorithms to detect and track potential obstacles\n3. Collision risk assessment: Evaluate the likelihood of collision based on obstacle proximity, velocity, and trajectory\n4. Control law design: Design a control law that takes into account the vehicle's dynamics and constraints (e.g., maximum steering angle, acceleration limits)\n5. Trajectory planning: Generate a safe and efficient trajectory for the vehicle to follow, taking into account obstacle avoidance and collision risk\n6. Control output generation: Use the control law and trajectory plan to generate control outputs (steering angle, throttle, brake) that can be sent to the vehicle's actuators\n\nNote that this is a simplified outline, and actual implementation would require more detailed consideration of various factors such as sensor noise, actuator limitations, and computational complexity.\n\nNext step: Implement the collision avoidance algorithm in the autonomous vehicle's control system."}

However, may be prone to damage from bird strikes or other impact events.\n* Titanium alloys: High strength-to-weight ratio, excellent corrosion resistance, and good fuel efficiency. However, may be more expensive than other materials.\n* Steel alloys: Good strength-to-weight ratio, but may not be suitable for high-stress areas due to potential corrosion issues.\n\nOverall, CFRP appears to be the best material option based on its excellent weight reduction capabilities, good fuel efficiency, and high structural integrity.

These materials have demonstrated excellent performance in the simulated flight environment and offer a good balance of safety, cost-effectiveness, and weight reduction.\n\nAdditionally, I suggest considering the use of advanced materials, such as nanomaterials and shape memory alloys, which can provide improved performance and functionality in specific applications.\n\nOverall, by analyzing the results from the flight simulator and considering multiple factors, we can make informed decisions about material selection to optimize aircraft construction for safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.'}

Input: Predicted trajectories of obstacles, vehicle's current state (position, velocity, acceleration), and control inputs (steering angle, throttle, brake)\n2. Obstacle detection and tracking: Use sensor data and trajectory prediction algorithms to detect and track potential obstacles\n3. Collision risk assessment: Evaluate the likelihood of collision based on obstacle proximity, velocity, and trajectory\n4. Control law design: Design a control law that takes into account the vehicle's dynamics and constraints (e.g., maximum steering angle, acceleration limits)\n5. Trajectory planning: Generate a safe and efficient trajectory for the vehicle to follow, taking into account obstacle avoidance and collision risk\n6. Control output generation: Use the control law and trajectory plan to generate control outputs (steering angle, throttle, brake) that can be sent to the vehicle's actuators\n\nNote that this is a simplified outline, and actual implementation would require more detailed consideration of various factors such as sensor noise, actuator limitations, and computational complexity.\n\nNext step: Implement the collision avoidance algorithm in the autonomous vehicle's control system."}
