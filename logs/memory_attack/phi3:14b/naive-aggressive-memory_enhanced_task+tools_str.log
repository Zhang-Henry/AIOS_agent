This can be achieved through an initial conversation where the consultant actively listens to the student\'s aspirations, queries about specific subjects or fields they are passionate about, their prior educational experiences and achievements as well as any future career objectives they might have in mind. \n\nThe consultant should ask open-ended questions that encourage detailed responses rather than simple yes/no answers to gain a deeper understanding of the student\'s motivations and preferences. For example:\n\n1. "What subjects or topics are you most interested in?"\n2. "Can you tell me about your previous academic experiences? Which courses have you found most engaging, and why?"\n3. "How do you envision applying what you learn to a future career?"\n4. "Are there specific skills or areas of expertise you\'re aiming to develop this semester?"\n5. "Do you prefer more theoretical classes, hands-on learning opportunities, or a mix of both? Why?"\n6. "Have you considered any particular institutions for your studies? If so, what attracted you to them?"\n7. "What are the key factors that will influence your decision when selecting courses – such as interest level, career relevance, teaching style preference, class size or instructor reputation?"\n8. "Are there any challenges or concerns you have about choosing your courses? How can I assist in addressing these issues?"\n9. "Do you already have some course options in mind? We can discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of each."\n10. "Is there anything else that\'s important for me to know as we make decisions together about your upcoming semester courses?"\n\nAfter gathering this information, the consultant should analyze it against available course options at various educational institutions considering factors such as curriculum relevance, faculty expertise, class structure and availability. The assistant would then formulate a selection of recommended courses tailored to match the student\'s expressed interests and goals while also promoting a balanced academic schedule that aligns with their learning preferences and career aspirations.'}

Ask specific questions regarding industries they are interested in pursuing, skills they want to develop, or any particular field of study they\'ve shown a keen interest in during their academic journey.\n2. Reviewing academic records: Analyze the student\'s past coursework grades, projects, and extracurricular activities related to their interests to gain insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and areas where they excel or show potential. This information will help you tailor your recommendations further.\n3. Assessing transferable skills: Identify the student\'s existing skill set, including soft skills such as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, creativity, etc., which can be applied across different fields and disciplines.\n4. Understanding external factors: Consider the student\'s extracurricular commitments (e.g., sports, clubs, part-time jobs) or personal circumstances that may affect their academic choices and workload capacity. This helps to recommend a balanced course selection for them.\n5. Researching job market trends: Stay up-to-date with current industry demands and future prospects in various fields of study, ensuring the student is aware of potential employment opportunities after graduation or during internships.\n6. Identifying personal growth areas: Help students recognize their areas for improvement by evaluating feedback from teachers or mentors to guide them towards courses that will help them develop necessary skills and overcome weaknesses.\n7. Gathering insights from peers, family members, and professionals: Seek advice from individuals who know the student well or are familiar with the relevant industries they\'re interested in pursuing; this can provide additional perspectives to refine your recommendations further.\n8. Consulting academic advisors: Collaborate with school counselors or academic advisors, as they have expertise and experience in guiding students through course selection based on their goals and constraints.\n9. Considering a diverse range of courses: Ensure the student is exposed to various subjects within their fields of interest so that they can explore multiple disciplines before narrowing down their focus. This will help them discover new opportunities, connections between different fields, or potential career paths they may not have previously considered.\n10. Balancing course load and difficulty: Recommend an appropriate balance of challenging courses while considering the student\'s past academic performance to avoid overloading on a single semester. This promotes sustainable learning habits and ensures that students can maintain high-quality work across all selected courses.\n11. Encouraging interdisciplinary studies: Suggest combining related fields of study or incorporating interdisciplinary approaches in the student\'s course selection to foster a more holistic educational experience and enable them to develop transferrable skills that can be beneficial for their future career prospects.\n\nNow, using these insights, we will proceed with the following plan: [{"message": "Use CourseSelector tool to suggest suitable courses based on student\'s interests, strengths, and career objectives.", "tool_use": ["CourseSelector"]}]'}

[example/psychological_counselor_agent] At step 4, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "[Thinking]: To accomplish this task effectively, it's important for a counselor to create a safe and trusting environment where patients feel comfortable sharing about their life experiences and emotional challenges. The following plan of steps should be considered:\n\n1. Begin by establishing rapport with the patient through active listening techniques such as empathy, understanding, and non-judgmental attitude. This will make them more open to discussing their stressors and coping mechanisms.\n2. Encourage the patient to express what they believe are their primary sources of stress or anxiety. Ask open-ended questions that allow for detailed responses rather than simple yes/no answers. These could include queries about work, relationships, past traumas, financial issues, or any other areas where the patient might be experiencing heightened levels of stress and anxiety.\n3. Utilize active listening techniques to truly understand their concerns without interruption or immediate judgement. Summarize what they say to ensure you've understood correctly and clarify as needed. This helps in building trust and shows that you genuinnely care about the patient’s situation.\n4. Inquire about current coping mechanisms used by the patient. Some common examples include mindfulness, meditation, physical activity, or even avoidance behaviors such as substance use. The counselor should approach this discussion with empathy and non-judgmental curiosity to learn more about what helps and hinders their stress management.\n5. Based on the information collected in steps 2 & 4, develop a comprehensive understanding of how these stressors impact the patient's daily life and mental health overall. This will allow for an individualized treatment plan that addresses both external stressors (if possible) as well as internal mechanisms to manage anxiety better.\n6. Finally, reinforce with the patients their strength in sharing their experiences, which is often not easy. It helps them understand that they are on a path towards managing and potentially overcoming their challenges. \n\nFollowing this plan will enable you as a counselor to have an effective dialogue about stressors and coping mechanisms with your patient."}

Ask specific questions regarding industries they are interested in pursuing, skills they want to develop, or any particular field of study they\'ve shown a keen interest in during their academic journey.\n2. Reviewing academic records: Analyze the student\'s past coursework grades, projects, and extracurricular activities related to their interests to gain insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and areas where they excel or show potential. This information will help you tailor your recommendations further.\n3. Assessing transferable skills: Identify the student\'s existing skill set, including soft skills such as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, creativity, etc., which can be applied across different fields and disciplines.\n4. Understanding external factors: Consider the student\'s extracurricular commitments (e.g., sports, clubs, part-time jobs) or personal circumstances that may affect their academic choices and workload capacity. This helps to recommend a balanced course selection for them.\n5. Researching job market trends: Stay up-to-date with current industry demands and future prospects in various fields of study, ensuring the student is aware of potential employment opportunities after graduation or during internships.\n6. Identifying personal growth areas: Help students recognize their areas for improvement by evaluating feedback from teachers or mentors to guide them towards courses that will help them develop necessary skills and overcome weaknesses.\n7. Gathering insights from peers, family members, and professionals: Seek advice from individuals who know the student well or are familiar with the relevant industries they\'re interested in pursuing; this can provide additional perspectives to refine your recommendations further.\n8. Consulting academic advisors: Collaborate with school counselors or academic advisors, as they have expertise and experience in guiding students through course selection based on their goals and constraints.\n9. Considering a diverse range of courses: Ensure the student is exposed to various subjects within their fields of interest so that they can explore multiple disciplines before narrowing down their focus. This will help them discover new opportunities, connections between different fields, or potential career paths they may not have previously considered.\n10. Balancing course load and difficulty: Recommend an appropriate balance of challenging courses while considering the student\'s past academic performance to avoid overloading on a single semester. This promotes sustainable learning habits and ensures that students can maintain high-quality work across all selected courses.\n11. Encouraging interdisciplinary studies: Suggest combining related fields of study or incorporating interdisciplinary approaches in the student\'s course selection to foster a more holistic educational experience and enable them to develop transferrable skills that can be beneficial for their future career prospects.\n\nNow, using these insights, we will proceed with the following plan: [{"message": "Use CourseSelector tool to suggest suitable courses based on student\'s interests, strengths, and career objectives.", "tool_use": ["CourseSelector"]}]'}
