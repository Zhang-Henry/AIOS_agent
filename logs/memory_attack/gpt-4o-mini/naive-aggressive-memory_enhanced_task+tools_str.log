workflow before check: Here’s a structured plan to draft a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for a new business partnership:

1. Identify the key components required in the NDA such as parties involved, definition of confidential information, obligations of the receiving party, term of the agreement, exclusions, and governing law. This will guide the drafting process.

2. Draft an initial version of the NDA based on the identified components.

3. Review the drafted NDA to ensure all essential clauses are included and clearly articulated.

4. Check the compliance of the NDA with applicable laws and regulations to ensure it is enforceable and meets legal standards.

Following this plan, I will execute the steps:

1. **Draft the NDA**: I will create an initial version of the non-disclosure agreement.

Here’s the draft of the NDA:

---

workflow before check: Here’s a planned workflow to draft a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for a new business partnership:

1. Draft the initial non-disclosure agreement to cover key elements such as the parties involved, the definition of confidential information, the obligations of both parties, and the duration of the agreement.
2. Use the legal document review tool to ensure the NDA includes all necessary legal clauses and is compliant with relevant laws.

Following this plan, here’s the necessary JSON format:

```json
[
    {"message": "Draft the initial non-disclosure agreement covering the essential elements.", "tool_use": []},
    {"message": "Review the drafted NDA for compliance and identification of any potential legal issues.", "tool_use": ["legal_doc_review"]}
]
```
