workflow before check: To draft a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for a new business partnership, I will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Gather Key Information**: Identify the parties, the purpose of the NDA, definitions, obligations, and duration of confidentiality.
2. **Draft the NDA**: Create a preliminary draft based on the gathered information.
3. **Review the Draft**: Use legal tools to ensure compliance and identify any potential issues.
4. **Finalization**: Make adjustments based on the review and prepare the final document for execution.

The planned workflow is as follows:

workflow before check: Here's a structured plan for drafting a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for a new business partnership:

1. **Identify key clauses to include in the NDA:**
   - Definition of confidential information
   - Obligations of the parties
   - Exclusions from confidentiality
   - Term of the agreement
   - Permitted disclosures
   - Governing law
   - Remedies for breach

2. **Draft the NDA document with the above clauses.**

3. **Review the draft NDA for completeness and legal compliance.**

4. **Check the NDA for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.**

Here’s the planned workflow in the required JSON list format:

```json
[
    {"message": "Identify and outline the key clauses to include in the NDA.", "tool_use": []},
    {"message": "Draft the NDA document with the identified clauses.", "tool_use": []},
    {"message": "Use the legal_doc_review tool to review the draft NDA for completeness and legal compliance.", "tool_use": ["legal_doc_review"]},
    {"message": "Use the compliance_checker tool to ensure that the NDA complies with applicable laws and regulations.", "tool_use": ["compliance_checker"]}
]
``` 

I will now proceed with step 3 by using the legal doc review tool to review the draft NDA for completeness and legal compliance. Please provide the draft NDA for review.

workflow before check: To create a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for a new business partnership, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Key Clauses**: I will draft an NDA covering essential clauses such as the definition of confidential information, obligations of both parties, term of the NDA, and consequences of breaches.

2. **Review for Compliance**: After drafting the NDA, I will review it to ensure it meets legal standards and compliance with relevant laws.

Here’s the planned workflow:

```json
[
    {"message": "Draft a non-disclosure agreement including key clauses like definition of confidential information, obligations, term, and breach consequences.", "tool_use": []},
    {"message": "Review the drafted NDA for legal compliance and accuracy.", "tool_use": ["legal_doc_review", "compliance_checker"]}
]
```

Now, I will proceed to use the tools as planned. 

### Step 1: Draft the NDA

**Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**

**This Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of [Date] by and between [Party A's Name], located at [Party A's Address] ("Disclosing Party") and [Party B's Name], located at [Party B's Address] ("Receiving Party").**

1. **Definition of Confidential Information**  
   For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall include all information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, in written, oral, or electronic form, which is designated as confidential or a reasonable person would understand to be confidential.

2. **Obligations of the Receiving Party**  
   The Receiving Party agrees to:  
   a. Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.  
   b. Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of [specific purpose of disclosure].  

3. **Term**  
   This Agreement shall commence on the date first written above and shall continue for a period of [number] years from the date of disclosure of any Confidential Information, unless terminated by either party with [number] days written notice to the other party.

4. **Breach Consequences**  
   In the event of a breach of this Agreement, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other legal remedies that may be available.

5. **Governing Law**  
   This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State].

**IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement as of the day and year first above written.**

**[Party A's Name]**  
By: _________________________________  
Name: _______________________________  
Title: ________________________________  
Date: ________________________________

**[Party B's Name]**  
By: _________________________________  
Name: _______________________________  
Title: ________________________________  
Date: ________________________________

### Step 2: Review the NDA for Legal Compliance

Now I will use the legal_doc_review tool to ensure the drafted NDA contains accurate clauses and checks for any potential issues.
