Recommended for modern aircraft designs to improve fuel efficiency and performance.\n4. **Steel Alloys**: While heavier, steel alloys provide excellent durability and are recommended for landing gear and other high-stress areas where weight is less of a concern.\n\nOverall, a combination of these materials should be used to optimize performance, safety, and efficiency in aircraft construction.'}]
