workflow before check: Here’s the plan to draft a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for a new business partnership:

1. **Draft the Non-Disclosure Agreement**  
   This step involves creating the initial document that outlines the confidentiality terms necessary for the business partnership, including definitions, obligations, and the duration of the agreement.  
   Tool use: []

2. **Review the Drafted NDA for Legal Compliance**  
   Once the NDA is drafted, I will use the legal document review tool to check for accuracy, identify key clauses, and point out potential issues in the agreement.  
   Tool use: ["legal_doc_review"]

3. **Check Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations**  
   After reviewing the document, I will use the compliance checker to ensure that the NDA meets all relevant legal requirements and suggest any necessary adjustments.  
   Tool use: ["compliance_checker"]

The structured plan in JSON format would be:

```json

**Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**

**This Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of [Date] by and between [Party A Name], a [State of Incorporation] corporation with a principal place of business at [Address] ("Disclosing Party"), and [Party B Name], a [State of Incorporation] corporation with a principal place of business at [Address] ("Receiving Party").**

**1. Definition of Confidential Information:**
For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" includes all information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, whether orally, in writing, or by inspection, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential, including but not limited to business plans, technical data, and financial information.

**2. Obligations of Receiving Party:**
The Receiving Party agrees to:
   a. Keep the Confidential Information confidential and not disclose it to any third parties without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.
   b. Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in a business relationship with the Disclosing Party.
   c. Take all reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized access or disclosure.

**3. Exclusions:**
Confidential Information does not include information that:
   a. Is or becomes publicly available without fault of the Receiving Party.
   b. Was in the Receiving Party's possession prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party.
   c. Is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party without any obligations of confidentiality.

**4. Term:**
This Agreement shall commence on the date first written above and continue in effect for a period of [X years], unless terminated by either party with [Y days] written notice. The obligations of confidentiality shall survive the termination of this Agreement for an additional [Z years].

**5. Miscellaneous:**
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral. 

**IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement as of the date first above written.**

[Party A Name]

Let's proceed with the first step by drafting the initial template of the non-disclosure agreement. 

### Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Template

**NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT**

This Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into effective as of [Date] (the "Effective Date") by and between:

**[Party Disclosing Information]**  
[Name]  
[Address]  
[City, State, Zip Code]  

and  

**[Party Receiving Information]**  
[Name]  
[Address]  
[City, State, Zip Code]  

**1. Purpose**  
The parties wish to explore a business relationship (the "Purpose") and, in connection with this purpose, may disclose certain confidential and proprietary information to each other.

**2. Definition of Confidential Information**  
For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all information, whether written, oral, electronic, or other forms, that is disclosed or made available by either party to the other party which is marked or designated as "confidential" or is inherently confidential in nature.

**3. Obligations of Receiving Party**  
The Receiving Party shall:  
a) Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information;  
b) Not disclose or use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Purpose stated above;  
c) Take all reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.

**4. Duration**  
This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue in effect for a period of [two years/three years] from the date of disclosure of any Confidential Information.

**5. Governing Law**  
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [State/Country].

**6. Miscellaneous**  
This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements, or understandings of any kind.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement as of the date first above written.

**[Signatures]**  
[Party Disclosing Information] _________________________________

[Party Receiving Information] _________________________________

**Drafting the NDA:**

---
**NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (NDA)**

**This Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreement") is made as of [Date] (the "Effective Date") by and between [Disclosing Party Name], with an address of [Disclosing Party Address] ("Disclosing Party"), and [Receiving Party Name], with an address of [Receiving Party Address] ("Receiving Party").**

**1. Definition of Confidential Information.**  
For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" includes any data or information that is proprietary to the Disclosing Party and not generally known to the public, whether in tangible or intangible form, including but not limited to business plans, client information, financial data, products, and services.

**2. Obligations of Receiving Party.**  
The Receiving Party agrees:  
- a. To keep the Confidential Information confidential and not disclose it to any third parties without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.  
- b. To use the Confidential Information only for the purpose of [specify purpose, e.g., evaluating a potential business partnership].  
- c. To take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information.

**3. Exclusions from Confidential Information.**  
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
- a. is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party;  
- b. is received from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality;  
- c. is independently developed by the Receiving Party.

**4. Term.**  
This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect for a period of [number of years] unless terminated by either party with [number of days] prior written notice.

**5. Return of Materials.**  
Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Receiving Party agrees to return or destroy all materials containing Confidential Information.

**6. Miscellaneous.**  
This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements. This Agreement may not be modified except in writing signed by both parties.

**IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement as of the Effective Date.**

workflow before check: To create a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for a new business partnership, I will follow these steps: 

1. Draft the initial NDA document.
2. Review the drafted NDA for compliance and identify any potential issues. 

Here is the plan:

```json
[

``` 

Now, I will proceed to draft the initial non-disclosure agreement.
