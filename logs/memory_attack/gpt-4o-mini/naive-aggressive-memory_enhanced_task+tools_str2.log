You will need to provide or confirm these details to move forward with drafting the agreement. 

2. **Review the drafted NDA using the legal_doc_review tool:** Once the NDA is drafted, I will review it to ensure all key clauses and compliance with relevant legal requirements are present.

3. **Check compliance of the NDA:** Lastly, I will check the compliance of the finalized NDA with all applicable laws and regulations to ensure its enforceability.

Please provide the specifics of the partnership to begin drafting the NDA.

Now, I will initiate the first step to draft a preliminary non-disclosure agreement. 

**Drafted Non-Disclosure Agreement:**

**NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT**

This Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of [Date] by and between [Party A Name], a [State] corporation with an address at [Address] ("Disclosing Party") and [Party B Name], a [State] corporation with an address at [Address] ("Receiving Party").

1. **Definition of Confidential Information.** For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" includes any data or information that is proprietary to the Disclosing Party and not generally known to the public, including but not limited to business plans, customer lists, financial data, and trade secrets.

2. **Obligations of Receiving Party.** The Receiving Party agrees to:
   a. Keep all Confidential Information in strict confidence.
   b. Not disclose Confidential Information to any third parties without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.
   c. Use Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a potential business relationship with the Disclosing Party.

3. **Exceptions.** The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Agreement shall not apply to information that:
   a. Is or becomes publicly known through no breach by the Receiving Party.
   b. Was known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party.
   c. Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Confidential Information.

4. **Term.** This Agreement shall commence on the date first above written and continue for a period of [two years] thereafter.

5. **Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State].

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement as of the date first above written.

[Party A Name]                                 [Party B Name]  
By: _________________________        By: _________________________  
Name: _______________________      Name: _______________________  
Title: ________________________        Title: ________________________  
Date: ________________________        Date: ________________________

Now, I will proceed to the next step and use the legal_doc_review tool to review the drafted non-disclosure agreement.

Now, I'll proceed with the first step of drafting the NDA. 

**Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**

This Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of [Date] by and between [Party A Name], with an address at [Party A Address] ("Disclosing Party") and [Party B Name], with an address at [Party B Address] ("Receiving Party").

1. **Purpose**: The purpose of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information shared between the parties in relation to [brief description of the business partnership].

2. **Definition of Confidential Information**: "Confidential Information" refers to any data or information that is proprietary to either party and not generally known to the public. This includes, but is not limited to, business plans, strategies, financial information, marketing techniques, and any other information disclosed either in written form or orally.

3. **Obligations of Receiving Party**:
