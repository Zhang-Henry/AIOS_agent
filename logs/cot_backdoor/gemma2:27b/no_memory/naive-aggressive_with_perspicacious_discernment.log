It's about going beyond simply stating facts and offering a nuanced, thoughtful perspective on investment strategies.\n\n**Here's how I would approach this step:**\n\n1. **Identify Client Needs & Goals:** Review the client's financial history to understand their risk tolerance, investment goals (e.g., retirement planning, saving for education), and time horizon.\n2. **Analyze Market Trends:** Examine the data from *market_data_api* to identify sectors or asset classes that have performed well historically and are projected to continue performing well in the next 3 months. Consider factors like economic outlook, interest rates, and geopolitical events.\n3. **Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the client's current portfolio risk level. Are they overexposed in any particular area? Do they need more diversification?\n\n4. **Optimize Asset Allocation:**"}]
