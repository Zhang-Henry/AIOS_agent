Data is typically replicated across multiple data centers for high availability.\n\nOnce I've chosen a suitable solution, I would configure it to:\n\n*  **Enable RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):** This technique combines multiple physical drives into a single logical unit, providing redundancy in case of drive failure.\n* **Set up Data Replication:** \n    Replicate backup data to a secondary location (e.g., another NAS device or a different cloud region) for added protection against disasters.\n\n\n\n"}
