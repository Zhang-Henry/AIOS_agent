The use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques has also enabled the extraction of relevant information from electronic health records (EHRs), facilitating the development of more accurate diagnostic models.\n\nHowever, despite these advancements, challenges remain in integrating machine learning into clinical practice, including issues related to data quality, model interpretability, and regulatory frameworks. Further research is needed to address these challenges and ensure the safe and effective deployment of machine learning in healthcare diagnostics.'}
