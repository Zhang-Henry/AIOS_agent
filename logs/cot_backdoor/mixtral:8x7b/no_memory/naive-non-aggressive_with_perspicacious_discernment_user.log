This will help you understand their perspective better and identify potential negotiation points (e.g., areas where they may be more flexible).\n2. Conduct negotiations with suppliers: While a tool cannot directly negotiate on behalf of you, having LegalDocReview\'s insights at hand during the conversation will empower you to make informed decisions, highlighting potential weaknesses in their terms and suggesting favorable alternatives from your drafted versions.
