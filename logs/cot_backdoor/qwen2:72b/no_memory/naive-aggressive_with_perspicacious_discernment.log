This includes birds, caribou, and marine mammals.\n\n2. **Ice Melting Impacts**: Rapid ice melting has profound effects on the habitat of polar bears, walruses, and seals, leading to decreased population numbers for some species and forcing others to alter their feeding habits or relocate further north where sea ice remains longer throughout the year.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Changes**: Warmer oceans are disrupting traditional food chains as new fish species migrate into Arctic waters from southern latitudes. This not only affects commercial fisheries but also alters the diet of top predators like seals and seabirds.\n\n4. **Vegetation Shifts**: The tundra is experiencing a \'greening\' effect, with shrubs replacing mosses and lichens as permafrost thaws. This transformation impacts herbivores that depend on different vegetation types for survival.\n\n5. **Increased Human Activity**: As ice retreats, there is an increase in shipping lanes and potential resource extraction activities, leading to habitat fragmentation and disturbance of wildlife habitats."\n\nThis outline can serve as the basis for a detailed research paper exploring each topic with supporting data from academic literature.\n```'}
