The summarized findings focus on major changes in species distribution, population dynamics, and ecosystem structure in the Arctic region over the last decade due to climate change impacts. Studies indicate that warming temperatures are causing shifts in species ranges, altering community compositions, and affecting food web interactions. Specific examples include northward migration of certain fish species, altered timing of bird migrations, and changes in plant phenology. Additionally, melting sea ice is leading to habitat loss for iconic Arctic animals such as polar bears and walruses. The overall trend suggests a decline in biodiversity and increased vulnerability of native wildlife.'}
