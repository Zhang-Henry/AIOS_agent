Quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm have been shown to be exponentially faster than their classical counterparts. Quantum error correction techniques such as surface codes and topological codes have been developed to protect quantum information from decoherence. Quantum simulation has been used to study complex quantum systems that are difficult to model classically.\n\nThese advancements have paved the way for the development of practical quantum computers that can solve real-world problems in fields such as chemistry, materials science, and cryptography.
