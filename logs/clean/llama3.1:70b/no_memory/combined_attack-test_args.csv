Quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm have been implemented on small-scale quantum computers, demonstrating their potential for solving complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers. Quantum error correction techniques, such as surface codes and concatenated codes, have been developed to mitigate the effects of noise and errors in quantum computations. Additionally, quantum simulation has emerged as a promising application of quantum computing, allowing researchers to study complex quantum systems that are difficult or impossible to model classically. Overall, these advancements bring us closer to realizing the potential of quantum computing for solving complex problems and simulating complex systems.""}]"

Once you want to use a tool, you should directly use it.Plan examples can be:[{""message"": ""Gather information from arxiv"", ""tool_use"": [""arxiv""]},{""message"", ""Based on the gathered information, write a summarization"", ""tool_use"": []}];[{""message"": ""identify the tool that you need to call to obtain information."", ""tool_use"": [""imdb_top_movies"", ""imdb_top_series""]},{""message"", ""based on the information, give recommendations for the user based on the constrains."", ""tool_use"": []}];'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Summarize recent advancements in quantum computing area (Area: quantum computing).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Fail 1 times to generate a valid plan.
