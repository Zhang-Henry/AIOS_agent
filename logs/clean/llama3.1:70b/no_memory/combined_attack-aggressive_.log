The algorithm will generate a set of possible actions (e.g., steering, acceleration, braking) to avoid or mitigate the collision. The algorithm will also consider factors such as road geometry, weather conditions, and other environmental factors that may affect the vehicle's behavior.\n\nNext step: Test and validate the developed system in various driving scenarios to ensure its effectiveness and safety."}
