The thawing of permafrost is also releasing methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which is exacerbating climate change.\n\nOcean acidification and changes in sea ice cover are affecting marine ecosystems, including phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish populations. This has cascading effects on the entire food web, from small invertebrates to large predators like orcas and whales.\n\nIn addition, climate-driven changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and soil moisture are altering vegetation composition, structure, and function across Arctic tundras.
