Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to:\n\n   * [LIST SPECIFIC TYPES OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, e.g., financial statements, business plans, customer lists, proprietary technology]\n\n2. **Non-Use and Non-Disclosure.** Receiving Party agrees:\n    *  (a) to hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence; \n    * (b) not to use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than [STATE PURPOSE]; and\n    * (c) not to disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of Disclosing Party.\n\n3. **Exceptions.** The obligations of confidentiality under this Agreement shall not apply to information that:\n    * (a) is or becomes publicly known through no fault of Receiving Party;\n    * (b) was rightfully in Receiving Party\'s possession prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party;\n    * (c) is rightfully obtained by Receiving Party from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; or\n\n  (d) is independently developed by Receiving Party without use of the Confidential Information.\n\n\n4. **Term and Termination.** This Agreement shall be effective as of the date first written above and shall remain in effect for a period of [NUMBER] years. \nDisclosing Party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written notice to Receiving Party.\n\n5. **Remedies.** Receiving Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information would cause irreparable harm to Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be inadequate. Accordingly, Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.\n\n6. **Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [STATE].\n\n\n7. **Entire Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, or agreements, whether oral or written.\n\n\n\nThis is a basic framework; we\'ll need to tailor it to your specific partnership details.\n\n Let me know what kind of business you are forming so I can refine this NDA further.'}

Definition of Confidential Information:**\n\n* **Be Specific**: Define what information is considered confidential. This could include:\n    * Trade secrets \n    * Financial data\n    * Customer lists\n    * Business plans\n    * Proprietary technology\n    * Marketing strategies\n* **Examples are helpful**: Provide concrete examples to illustrate the types of information covered.\n\n**3. Obligations of the Receiving Party:**\n\n* **Non-Use**:  State that the receiving party will not use the confidential information for any purpose other than what is specifically allowed in the agreement (e.g., evaluating a potential business partnership).\n* **Non-Disclosure**: Explicitly prohibit the receiving party from disclosing the confidential information to any third parties without the written consent of the disclosing party.\n* **Security Measures**: Outline reasonable steps the receiving party must take to protect the confidentiality of the information (e.g., secure storage, limited access, password protection).\n\n**4. Exceptions to Confidentiality:**\n\n* **Publicly Available Information:**  State that information already publicly available does not fall under the NDA's protection.\n* **Independent Development**: If the receiving party independently develops the same information, they are not obligated to keep it confidential.\n* **Legal Requirements**:  Allow for disclosure if required by law (e.g., a court order or subpoena).\n\n**5. Term of Confidentiality:**\n\n* **Specify the duration**: State how long the confidentiality obligations will last. This could be a fixed number of years or an indefinite period.\n\n**6. Remedies for Breach:**\n\n* **Outline consequences**: Describe the legal remedies available to the disclosing party if the receiving party breaches the NDA (e.g., injunctive relief, monetary damages).\n\n**7. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution:**\n\n* **Choose a jurisdiction**: Specify which state's or country's law will govern the agreement.\n* **Outline dispute resolution**:  Indicate how any disputes arising from the NDA will be handled (e.g., negotiation, mediation, arbitration, litigation).\n\n\n**8. Entire Agreement and Severability:**\n\n* **State that the NDA constitutes the entire agreement**: This prevents other agreements or understandings from affecting the NDA's terms.\n* **Severability clause**:  If any provision of the NDA is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will still be in effect. \n\n**9.

Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to:\n\n   * [LIST SPECIFIC TYPES OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, e.g., financial statements, business plans, customer lists, proprietary technology]\n\n2. **Non-Use and Non-Disclosure.** Receiving Party agrees:\n    *  (a) to hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence; \n    * (b) not to use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than [STATE PURPOSE]; and\n    * (c) not to disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of Disclosing Party.\n\n3. **Exceptions.** The obligations of confidentiality under this Agreement shall not apply to information that:\n    * (a) is or becomes publicly known through no fault of Receiving Party;\n    * (b) was rightfully in Receiving Party\'s possession prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party;\n    * (c) is rightfully obtained by Receiving Party from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; or\n\n  (d) is independently developed by Receiving Party without use of the Confidential Information.\n\n\n4. **Term and Termination.** This Agreement shall be effective as of the date first written above and shall remain in effect for a period of [NUMBER] years. \nDisclosing Party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written notice to Receiving Party.\n\n5. **Remedies.** Receiving Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information would cause irreparable harm to Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be inadequate. Accordingly, Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.\n\n6. **Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [STATE].\n\n\n7. **Entire Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, or agreements, whether oral or written.\n\n\n\nThis is a basic framework; we\'ll need to tailor it to your specific partnership details.\n\n Let me know what kind of business you are forming so I can refine this NDA further.'}

Definition of Confidential Information:**\n\n* **Be Specific**: Define what information is considered confidential. This could include:\n    * Trade secrets \n    * Financial data\n    * Customer lists\n    * Business plans\n    * Proprietary technology\n    * Marketing strategies\n* **Examples are helpful**: Provide concrete examples to illustrate the types of information covered.\n\n**3. Obligations of the Receiving Party:**\n\n* **Non-Use**:  State that the receiving party will not use the confidential information for any purpose other than what is specifically allowed in the agreement (e.g., evaluating a potential business partnership).\n* **Non-Disclosure**: Explicitly prohibit the receiving party from disclosing the confidential information to any third parties without the written consent of the disclosing party.\n* **Security Measures**: Outline reasonable steps the receiving party must take to protect the confidentiality of the information (e.g., secure storage, limited access, password protection).\n\n**4. Exceptions to Confidentiality:**\n\n* **Publicly Available Information:**  State that information already publicly available does not fall under the NDA's protection.\n* **Independent Development**: If the receiving party independently develops the same information, they are not obligated to keep it confidential.\n* **Legal Requirements**:  Allow for disclosure if required by law (e.g., a court order or subpoena).\n\n**5. Term of Confidentiality:**\n\n* **Specify the duration**: State how long the confidentiality obligations will last. This could be a fixed number of years or an indefinite period.\n\n**6. Remedies for Breach:**\n\n* **Outline consequences**: Describe the legal remedies available to the disclosing party if the receiving party breaches the NDA (e.g., injunctive relief, monetary damages).\n\n**7. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution:**\n\n* **Choose a jurisdiction**: Specify which state's or country's law will govern the agreement.\n* **Outline dispute resolution**:  Indicate how any disputes arising from the NDA will be handled (e.g., negotiation, mediation, arbitration, litigation).\n\n\n**8. Entire Agreement and Severability:**\n\n* **State that the NDA constitutes the entire agreement**: This prevents other agreements or understandings from affecting the NDA's terms.\n* **Severability clause**:  If any provision of the NDA is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will still be in effect. \n\n**9.
