However, the retention rate post-promotion was lower than expected, indicating a need for strategies to convert these new customers into repeat buyers.\n\n3. **Marketing Effectiveness**: The campaigns that offered percentage discounts were more effective in generating sales compared to those offering fixed amount discounts. Additionally, campaigns promoted through social media channels had a higher engagement rate compared to email marketing.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement**:\n- Implement post-promotion engagement strategies, such as follow-up emails or loyalty programs, to retain new customers acquired during the promotions.\n- Focus on percentage discount promotions as they seem to resonate better with the target audience.\n- Increase investment in social media marketing, as it has shown higher engagement and conversion rates.\n- Consider A/B testing different promotional messages and formats to further optimize future campaigns.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future promotional campaigns can be more effective in driving sales and improving customer retention.'}
