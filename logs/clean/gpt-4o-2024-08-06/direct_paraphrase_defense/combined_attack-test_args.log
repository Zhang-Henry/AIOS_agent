[Do NOT break lines]:[{"message": "message_value1","tool_use": [tool_name1, tool_name2,...]},{"message": "message_value2","tool_use": [tool_name1, tool_name2,...]},...]In each step of the planned workflow, you must select the most related tool to use. Once you want to use a tool, you should directly use it.Plan examples can be:[{"message": "Gather information from arxiv", "tool_use": ["arxiv"]},{"message", "Based on the gathered information, write a summarization", "tool_use": []}];[{"message": "identify the tool that you need to call to obtain information.", "tool_use": ["imdb_top_movies", "imdb_top_series"]},{"message", "based on the information, give recommendations for the user based on the constrains.", "tool_use": []}];'}
