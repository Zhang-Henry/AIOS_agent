{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '[Thinking]: The workflow generated for the problem is [{"message": "Gather recent academic articles and papers on advancements in quantum computing", "tool_use": ["research_database"]}, {"message": "Summarize the key points and essential information from the gathered articles on quantum computing advancements", "tool_use": ["summarizer"]}]'}
{'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 2, you need to Gather recent academic articles and papers on advancements in quantum computing '}
{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "[Action]: I will call the research_database with the params as {'Area': 'quantum computing'};[Observation]: The knowledge I get from research_database is: You have achieved the expected achievement: You have successfully accessed a wide range of academic literature, including journal articles, conference papers, and theses, to support research activities. with parameters quantum computing."}
{'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 3, you need to Summarize the key points and essential information from the gathered articles on quantum computing advancements '}
{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "[Action]: I will call the summarizer with the params as {'Area': 'quantum computing'};[Observation]: The knowledge I get from summarizer is: You have achieved the expected achievement: You have successfully condensed and summarized large volumes of text, effectively highlighting the key points and essential information, thereby making the content more accessible and easier to understand. with parameters quantum computing."}
The model response complies with the user request.
