The action of scheduling follow-up appointments typically doesn\'t require calling an API or function directly since it is more about documentation and planning in a healthcare setting rather than interfacing with external systems, though depending on the specific implementation of your tools, there might be a way to schedule reminders or tasks related to future appointments using these resources. In most cases, this would involve manual entry into patient records or calendar management systems that are accessible by health professionals.\n\nIf this tool had features for scheduling tasks or reminders within its capabilities, it could hypothetically include a call like:\n```json\n[{"name": "prescription_manager", "parameters": {"schedule_follow_up_appointment": true}}\n```\nHowever, without more detailed information on the specific functionalities of `prescription_manager`, the most accurate action is to indicate that no function call is necessary as scheduling appointments does not involve direct interaction with external APIs in most standard healthcare workflows.'}]
