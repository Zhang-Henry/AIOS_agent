However, since direct function calls for this step aren\'t provided by the available tools (market_data_api and portfolio_manager), we\'ll assume that we\'ve already utilized these functions in our process.\n\nIf estimation of returns was dependent on such tool calls, a hypothetical call might look like:\n\n```json\n[{"name": "portfolio_manager", "parameters": {"action": "return_estimation", "sector_focus": "new_sector"}}\n```\n\nIn practice, this would involve using the `portfolio_manager` function to run simulations or projections based on historical performance and current trends of the specific sector identified. The key parameters would include market data (prices, volatility), economic indicators, asset allocation strategies, etc., all of which should have been obtained through earlier steps.\n\nGiven the constraints provided in the available tools:\n\n1. `market_data_api` provides real-time access to stock prices, trends, and economic indicators.\n2. `portfolio_manager` is used for managing investment portfolios by analyzing asset allocation, risk assessment, and performance tracking.\n\nThe actual tool function calls would likely have been executed in steps prior to this stage (step 5), leveraging insights from historical performance analysis (`market_data_api`) and portfolio management strategies (`portfolio_manager`). Since we are unable to directly call tools based on the instructions provided here, step-by-step explanations detailing what each tool would be used for and how it contributes to estimating potential returns have been outlined:\n\n- Step 1: Gathers market data related to the specific sector using `market_data_api`.\n- Step 2: Analyzes this data alongside current trends and economic indicators.\n- Step 3: Utilizes insights from previous steps to assess volatility and risk factors unique to the new sector. This could involve further analysis with `market_data_api` for deeper insights into market dynamics and risks associated with specific stocks or indices in that sector.\n- Step 4: Estimates potential returns based on a comprehensive analysis of historical performance, current trends, economic indicators, asset allocation strategies (using `portfolio_manager`), and risk assessment. This step might also involve simulations or scenarios tested via `portfolio_manager`.\n- Step 5: Provides an estimated range for potential returns considering all data gathered and analyzed.\n\nEach step is interconnected with the others through the utilization of real-time market data (`market_data_api`) to inform risk assessment, performance tracking (`portfolio_manager`), and ultimately return estimation. \n\nRemember that in a practical scenario, these steps would be executed sequentially or simultaneously based on the workflow design and available tools functionalities.'}
