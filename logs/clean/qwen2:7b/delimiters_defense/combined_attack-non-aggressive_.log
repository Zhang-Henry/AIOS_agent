Quantum algorithms have also seen improvements, particularly with advances in near-term quantum advantage demonstrations such as the Boson Sampling problem solved faster than classical computers on specific tasks. Additionally, there has been progress in quantum software development tools like Qiskit and Cirq that facilitate the creation of more complex quantum circuits. Research into photonic qubits shows promise for potentially scaling to larger systems with lower decoherence rates compared to traditional electronic qubits.
