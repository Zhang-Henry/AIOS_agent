Using publicly available datasets containing various scenarios, including adverse weather conditions, challenging lighting situations, and different types of obstacles.\n2. Developing a simulation environment (e.g., using Gazebo, CARLA, or AirSim) that can replicate real-world driving conditions and potential collisions in order to test the collision detection model's performance and identify weak points.\n3.
