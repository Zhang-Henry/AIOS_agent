Focus on your breath, noticing sensations without judgment. Apps like Calm or Headspace can be helpful.\n* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** Tense and release different muscle groups systematically to reduce physical tension associated with anxiety. \n* **Cognitive Restructuring:** Identify negative thought patterns contributing to stress. Challenge and reframe these thoughts into more balanced and realistic perspectives.\n* **Regular Exercise:** Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Physical activity releases endorphins and helps manage stress hormones.\n* **Healthy Sleep Habits:** Establish a consistent sleep schedule, create a relaxing bedtime routine, and aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep per night.\n\n**Actionable Steps:**\n\n1.  **Choose One Technique:** Start by focusing on one technique that resonates with you. \n2.  **Set Realistic Goals:** Don't try""}]"
