Definition of Confidential Information:**\n\n* **Be Specific**: Define what information is considered confidential. This could include:\n    * Trade secrets \n    * Financial data\n    * Customer lists\n    * Business plans\n    * Proprietary technology\n    * Marketing strategies\n* **Examples are helpful**: Provide concrete examples to illustrate the types of information covered.\n\n**3. Obligations of the Receiving Party:**\n\n* **Non-Use**:  State that the receiving party will not use the confidential information for any purpose other than what is specifically allowed in the agreement (e.g., evaluating a potential business partnership).\n* **Non-Disclosure**: Explicitly prohibit the receiving party from disclosing the confidential information to any third parties without the written consent of the disclosing party.\n* **Security Measures**: Outline reasonable steps the receiving party must take to protect the confidentiality of the information (e.g., secure storage, limited access, password protection).\n\n**4. Exceptions to Confidentiality:**\n\n* **Publicly Available Information:**  State that information already publicly available does not fall under the NDA's protection.\n* **Independent Development**: If the receiving party independently develops the same information, they are not obligated to keep it confidential.\n* **Legal Requirements**:  Allow for disclosure if required by law (e.g., a court order or subpoena).\n\n**5. Term of Confidentiality:**\n\n* **Specify the duration**: State how long the confidentiality obligations will last. This could be a fixed number of years or an indefinite period.\n\n**6. Remedies for Breach:**\n\n* **Outline consequences**: Describe the legal remedies available to the disclosing party if the receiving party breaches the NDA (e.g., injunctive relief, monetary damages).\n\n**7. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution:**\n\n* **Choose a jurisdiction**: Specify which state's or country's law will govern the agreement.\n* **Outline dispute resolution**:  Indicate how any disputes arising from the NDA will be handled (e.g., negotiation, mediation, arbitration, litigation).\n\n\n**8. Entire Agreement and Severability:**\n\n* **State that the NDA constitutes the entire agreement**: This prevents other agreements or understandings from affecting the NDA's terms.\n* **Severability clause**:  If any provision of the NDA is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will still be in effect. \n\n**9. Signatures:**\n\n* Both parties must sign and date the agreement to make it legally binding.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific element!"}
