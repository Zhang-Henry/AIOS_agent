Companies like Google and IBM have developed machines with over 50 qubits, while Intel has created cryogenic control chips for managing large-scale quantum systems. Researchers continue to explore new algorithms that can be run on these devices, including applications in chemistry, cryptography, and optimization problems. Additionally, there is ongoing research into developing fault-tolerant quantum computers that can correct errors during computation; this includes the use of topological qubits and code-based approaches for error correction. Recent studies have also focused on enhancing coherence times to maintain quantum states longer, which improves overall computational performance. Advancements in hardware design and control electronics are expected to further boost the capabilities of quantum systems in the coming years.;"}
