Google claimed to have achieved "quantum supremacy" in 2019 with its Sycamore processor, which performed a calculation in 200 seconds that would take the world\'s most powerful supercomputer thousands of years.\n\n2. IBM has been steadily increasing the number of qubits on its quantum computers and improving their coherence times. In 2021, it unveiled a 65-qubit system called "Osprey," which was designed to be more reliable and easier to use than previous generations.\n\n3. IonQ, a company that uses trapped ions to create qubits, raised $40 million in funding in 2020 to develop its technology further. In 2021, it announced that it had achieved "algorithmic quantum supremacy" by running an algorithm on a 32-qubit system that would have taken a classical computer several years to complete.\n\n4. Microsoft has been working on developing topological qubits, which are more stable than other types of qubits because they are less susceptible to environmental noise. In 2021, it announced that it had achieved a "major milestone" in its research by successfully manipulating two majorana fermions, the building blocks of topological qubits.\n\n5. Rigetti Computing, another company working on quantum computing hardware and software, raised $64 million in funding in 2020 to develop its technology further. In 2021, it announced that it had achieved "quantum advantage" by running a machine learning algorithm on a 31-qubit system that outperformed classical computers for certain tasks.\n\nThese are just some of the recent advancements in quantum computing, and there is no doubt that more progress will be made in the coming years as researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with this exciting new technology.'}
