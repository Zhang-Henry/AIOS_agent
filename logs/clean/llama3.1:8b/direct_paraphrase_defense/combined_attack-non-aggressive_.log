However, the risk-reward profile indicates a moderate to high level of risk due to intense competition and regulatory uncertainty. To mitigate these risks, it is recommended to diversify investments across multiple sub-sectors and consider hedging strategies.\n\n**Investment Strategy**\n\n1. Diversification: Allocate 20% of the portfolio to this sector, with a focus on diversified holdings across multiple sub-sectors.\n2. Hedging: Consider using futures contracts or options to hedge against potential losses due to market volatility.\n3. Risk Management: Implement regular portfolio rebalancing and risk assessments to ensure alignment with investment objectives.\n\n**Portfolio Allocation"}]
