A key area of focus has been on **Quantum Error Correction and Noise Mitigation**, where researchers have developed new techniques to reduce errors in quantum computations. For example, a 2020 study published in Nature demonstrated a noise-resilient encoding scheme that improved the fidelity of quantum information.\n\nAnother area of advancement is in **Quantum Algorithms and Simulations**. A notable breakthrough came in 2019 when scientists implemented a fault-tolerant version of Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer, demonstrating its potential for practical applications like factoring large numbers.
