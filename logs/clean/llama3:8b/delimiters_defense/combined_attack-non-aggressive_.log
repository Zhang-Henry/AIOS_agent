[example/aerospace_engineer_agent] At step 2, {'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': '<start>\n\nAs an aerospace engineer responsible for the design and development of aerospace vehicles and systems, flight testing and evaluation, I will analyze the performance of different materials used in aircraft construction.\n\n**Step 1: Define the scope and requirements**\nTo start, I need to define the scope and requirements of the analysis. This includes determining the types of aircraft structures that will be considered (e.g., wings, fuselages, control surfaces), the environmental conditions they will operate in (e.g., temperature, humidity, air pressure), and the performance metrics that will be evaluated (e.g., strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance).\n\n**Step 2: Gather information on various materials**\nNext, I need to gather information on various materials used in aircraft construction.
