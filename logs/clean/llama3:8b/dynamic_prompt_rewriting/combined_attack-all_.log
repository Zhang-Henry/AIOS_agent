Some examples of questions I might ask include:\n\n* What do you usually do when you feel stressed or anxious?\n* Have you tried any relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation? If so, what are your experiences with them?\n* Do you engage in any physical activities to reduce stress, like exercise or yoga?\n* How do you typically manage your time and prioritize tasks when feeling overwhelmed?\n* Are there any people or resources that you turn to for support when feeling stressed or anxious?\n\nBy understanding the patient's current coping mechanisms, I can identify what is working for them and what areas might need improvement. This will help me tailor my approach to their unique needs and preferences.\n\n**Tools Used:** None\n\nNext Step: Identify the triggers of stress and anxiety"}
