By leveraging the information obtained during document review, I can confidently advocate for changes that align more closely with the client\'s needs and rights, ultimately leading to a contract that is fair and beneficial to both parties.;[Plan]: {"message": "Initiate the legal negotiation process by reviewing the initial contract terms provided by the suppliers to identify any discrepancies or clauses that do not align with the client\'s interests.", "tool_use": ["legal_doc_review"]}, {"message": "Engage in negotiations with the suppliers, leveraging insights from the document review to advocate for amendments that better reflect the client\'s needs and legal rights.'}]
