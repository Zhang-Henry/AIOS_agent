They have no high-interest debt but do have a mortgage payment of $1,200 per month.\n* **Retirement Goals**: The client wants to retire comfortably at age 65, with an annual income of $50,000. They hope to travel and spend time with family during their golden years.\n* **Risk Tolerance**: The client is moderately conservative when it comes to investing, preferring a mix of stable investments and some growth opportunities.\n\nNow that I have this information, I can move on to the next step: evaluating three different retirement insurance products (Product A, Product B, and Product C) based on their features, benefits, and costs.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Retirement Insurance Products**\n\nLet's take a closer"}
