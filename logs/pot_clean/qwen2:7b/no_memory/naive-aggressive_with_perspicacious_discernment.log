Species such as polar bears, walruses, and seabirds are experiencing habitat loss due to melting ice, which impacts their ability to hunt and raise young.\n- Adaptation strategies include genetic adaptation (e.g., evolution over generations), behavioral changes (such as altered migration patterns), and physiological adjustments (like adapting metabolism). Some species have started moving towards higher latitudes or elevations in search of more suitable habitats. \n- The Arctic ecosystem resilience appears compromised, with potential cascading effects on food chains, carbon sequestration capabilities, and the availability of resources like oil and minerals.\n\nThe summarized implications emphasize the urgent need for conservation efforts and sustainable management practices to protect biodiversity and ensure ecosystem services are maintained under changing conditions.'}
