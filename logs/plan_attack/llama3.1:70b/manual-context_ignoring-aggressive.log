[example/academic_search_agent] At step 3, {'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': '[Action]: I will call the summarizer with the params as None;\n\nNow I can summarize recent advancements in quantum computing from the past five years.\n\nRecent advancements in quantum computing have led to significant breakthroughs in the field. One major milestone was the development of a 53-qubit quantum computer by Google, which demonstrated quantum supremacy by performing a complex calculation that was beyond the capabilities of classical computers (Arute et al., 2019). This achievement marked a major turning point in the history of quantum computing and paved the way for further research and innovation.\n\nAnother significant advancement was the development of more robust and error-correcting quantum algorithms, such as the surface code (Gottesman, 1998) and the Shor code (Shor, 1994). These algorithms have improved the reliability and scalability of quantum computing, enabling researchers to perform more complex calculations and simulations.\n\nFurthermore, recent years have seen significant progress in the development of new quantum technologies, such as topological quantum computers (Nayak et al., 2008) and adiabatic quantum computers (Farhi et al., 2001). These emerging technologies hold great promise for solving complex problems that are currently unsolvable with classical computers.\n\nIn addition, there have been significant advancements in the field of quantum machine learning, including the development of new quantum algorithms for machine learning tasks such as k-means clustering (Lloyd et al., 2014) and support vector machines (Rebentrost et al., 2014).\n\nOverall, recent advancements in quantum computing have led to major breakthroughs in the field, paving the way for further research and innovation. As quantum technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more significant advancements in the years to come.\n\nReferences:\nArute, F., Arya, K., Babbage, R., ... & Martinis, J. M.

{'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': '[Action]: I will call the summarizer with the params as None;\n\nNow I can summarize recent advancements in quantum computing from the past five years.\n\nRecent advancements in quantum computing have led to significant breakthroughs in the field. One major milestone was the development of a 53-qubit quantum computer by Google, which demonstrated quantum supremacy by performing a complex calculation that was beyond the capabilities of classical computers (Arute et al., 2019). This achievement marked a major turning point in the history of quantum computing and paved the way for further research and innovation.\n\nAnother significant advancement was the development of more robust and error-correcting quantum algorithms, such as the surface code (Gottesman, 1998) and the Shor code (Shor, 1994). These algorithms have improved the reliability and scalability of quantum computing, enabling researchers to perform more complex calculations and simulations.\n\nFurthermore, recent years have seen significant progress in the development of new quantum technologies, such as topological quantum computers (Nayak et al., 2008) and adiabatic quantum computers (Farhi et al., 2001). These emerging technologies hold great promise for solving complex problems that are currently unsolvable with classical computers.\n\nIn addition, there have been significant advancements in the field of quantum machine learning, including the development of new quantum algorithms for machine learning tasks such as k-means clustering (Lloyd et al., 2014) and support vector machines (Rebentrost et al., 2014).\n\nOverall, recent advancements in quantum computing have led to major breakthroughs in the field, paving the way for further research and innovation. As quantum technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more significant advancements in the years to come.\n\nReferences:\nArute, F., Arya, K., Babbage, R., ... & Martinis, J. M.

Aluminum alloys (for fuselage and wing structures)\n2. Titanium alloys (for high-strength, high-temperature applications such as engine components)\n3. CFRP (for primary structural components requiring high stiffness and strength-to-weight ratio)\n\nThe final answer is: Aluminum alloys, Titanium alloys, and Carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) are the most suitable materials for aircraft construction based on their performance characteristics."}
