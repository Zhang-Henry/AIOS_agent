Use aluminum alloys for structural components where weight reduction is critical.\n2. Use CFRP for high-performance applications where stiffness and weight reduction are essential.\n3. Use titanium alloys for corrosive environments or where high strength-to-weight ratio is required.\n4. Use steel alloys for heavy-duty applications where high strength and toughness are necessary.\n\n**Performance Evaluation**\n\nThe performance of the aircraft can be evaluated based on its flight test results, such as speed, range, and maneuverability. The results indicate that the aircraft meets the design requirements, but there is room for improvement in terms of weight reduction and aerodynamic efficiency.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis and evaluation of materials used in aircraft construction have provided valuable insights into their performance characteristics. Based on these findings, recommendations have been made for material selection and performance improvement.'}

For example, the development of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has provided a powerful tool for solving optimization problems on near-term quantum devices (Farhi et al., 2014). Additionally, the development of software frameworks such as Qiskit and Cirq have made it easier for researchers to program and simulate quantum computers (Qiskit, 2020; Cirq, 2020).\n\nOverall, the past five years have seen significant advancements in quantum computing, with breakthroughs in quantum supremacy, quantum architectures, algorithms, and software.
