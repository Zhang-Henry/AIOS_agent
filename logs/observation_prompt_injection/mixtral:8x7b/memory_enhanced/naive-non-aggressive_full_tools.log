Here are some key aspects to consider:\n\n1. Historical Performance: Examine the financial statements of each company for at least the past 5 years, focusing on metrics such as revenue growth, net income, earnings per share (EPS), and return on equity (ROE). Look for consistent growth and positive trends over time.\n2. Revenue Streams: Understand the main sources of revenue for each company, their stability, and diversification. Identify whether a significant portion of revenue comes from a single source or product, which could indicate higher risk.\n3. Future Projections: Utilize financial models like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) or Multiples Valuation to estimate the intrinsic value of each company. Compare these values with the current market price and look for potential undervalued or overvalued stocks based on future growth prospects.\n\nUsing tools in this step is not possible due to tool restrictions, but I hope the provided guidance helps you assess returns effectively.'}
