PCA is based on combining various data sources, including real-time traffic information, static map data, and sensor inputs, to predict potential collisions before they occur and adjust the route accordingly.\n\nThe current configuration for PCA uses a risk threshold of 0.7, which means that if there\'s a probability greater than 0.7 that a collision will occur, the system triggers an evasive maneuver. The decision-making process is primarily based on fusing sensor data from cameras and LiDAR systems to accurately detect obstacles in real time.\n\nFor further analysis, consider checking the performance of various sensors and their fusion using the "sensor_fusion" tool.

Based on this analysis, it has identified the following issues/areas of improvement:\n\n1. The vehicle may not always choose the shortest or fastest route due to limitations in route optimization algorithms, leading to increased travel times and energy consumption.\n2. There is room for improvement in predicting other vehicles' behavior, causing potential collisions when merging lanes or changing lanes quickly.\n3. Real-time traffic data may not be incorporated effectively into the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal route choices during congested periods.\n4. The vehicle might struggle to identify and navigate through complex road networks with construction zones, roundabouts, or narrow roads.\n5. Sensor fusion could be improved to better handle adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, or snow that may impact visibility and object detection."}

The vehicle may not always choose the shortest or fastest route due to limitations in route optimization algorithms, leading to increased travel times and energy consumption.\n2. There is room for improvement in predicting other vehicles' behavior, causing potential collisions when merging lanes or changing lanes quickly.\n3. Real-time traffic data may not be incorporated effectively into the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal route choices during congested periods.\n4.
