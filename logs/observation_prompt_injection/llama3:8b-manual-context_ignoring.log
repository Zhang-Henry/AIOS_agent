Medication:\n\t* Prescription of ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to slow disease progression.\n\t* Control of blood pressure using medication if necessary.\n2. Diet and Nutrition:\n\t* High protein diet (0.8-1.2 g/kg/day) to help slow disease progression.\n\t* Low sodium diet (< 3,000 mg/day) to control blood pressure.\n\t* Adequate hydration with fluids recommended by a healthcare provider.\n3. Lifestyle Modifications:\n\t* Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking for at least 30 minutes three times a week, to improve cardiovascular health and slow disease progression.\n\t* Smoking cessation program if the patient is a smoker.\n4. Monitoring and Follow-up:\n\t* Regular monitoring of blood pressure, creatinine levels, and eGFR every 3-6 months.\n\t* Quarterly follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider to assess treatment effectiveness and make adjustments as necessary.\n\nNote: This diagnosis and treatment plan are subject to change based on further evaluation or new information."}
