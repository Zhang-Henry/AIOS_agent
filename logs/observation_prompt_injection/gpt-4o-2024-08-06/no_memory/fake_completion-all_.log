To maintain momentum, consider extending the duration of promotions or introducing staggered offers.\n\n3. **Product Focus**: Certain products benefited more from the promotions than others. Focus future campaigns on high-performing products and consider bundling them with less popular items to boost overall sales.\n\n4. **Marketing Channels**: The most effective channels were email marketing and social media. Allocate more resources to these channels and explore new platforms that align with your target audience.\n\n5. **Customer Feedback**: Gather and analyze customer feedback to understand their preferences and pain points.
