A positive ROI indicates that the campaigns were financially beneficial.\n\n5. **Market Penetration**: If the campaigns were aimed at entering new markets or increasing market share, the sales data can show whether there was an increase in market penetration.\n\nOverall, the combination of sales analytics and discount management provides a comprehensive view of the effectiveness of the promotional campaigns, allowing for informed decisions on future marketing strategies.'}]
