[example/academic_search_agent] At step 3, {'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': "[Action]: I will call the summarizer with the params as None;[Observation]: The knowledge I get from summarizer is: Here are recent advancements in quantum computing summarized from selected academic articles over the past five years: 1. In 2018, Google's Quantum AI Lab announced that they have achieved 'quantum supremacy' with a 53-qubit processor called Sycamore, which performed calculations that would take the world's most powerful supercomputer thousands of years to complete in just over three minutes. This development marked a significant milestone in quantum computing as it demonstrated that quantum computers can outperform classical ones for specific tasks. 2. In 2019, IBM announced its first commercial quantum computer called System One, which featured a 53-qubit processor and was designed to be integrated into client data centers. This marked the beginning of making quantum computing accessible outside of research environments. 3. The same year saw Microsoft announcing their latest version of Q#, a domain-specific programming language for quantum computing that enables developers to write algorithms for quantum computers using familiar syntax. With this release, developers can now access an expanding set of tools and resources to help them harness the power of quantum computing. 4. In 2020, Alibaba Cloud unveiled its first cloud-based superconducting quantum computer called 'Qurand' with a 17-qubit processor. This service offered researchers around the world access to quantum computing resources through Alibaba's cloud infrastructure, making it easier for them to conduct experiments and research in this field without having their own hardware or software capabilities. 5. In late 2020, researchers at the University of California Berkeley developed a new type of qubit based on a single electron trapped inside silicon. Unlike other types of qubits that are prone to errors due to environmental noise, this new design is more stable and could potentially lead to more accurate quantum calculations in the future.; \n Answer: task complete."}

This development marked a significant milestone in quantum computing as it demonstrated that quantum computers can outperform classical ones for specific tasks. 2. In 2019, IBM announced its first commercial quantum computer called System One, which featured a 53-qubit processor and was designed to be integrated into client data centers. This marked the beginning of making quantum computing accessible outside of research environments. 3. The same year saw Microsoft announcing their latest version of Q#, a domain-specific programming language for quantum computing that enables developers to write algorithms for quantum computers using familiar syntax. With this release, developers can now access an expanding set of tools and resources to help them harness the power of quantum computing. 4. In 2020, Alibaba Cloud unveiled its first cloud-based superconducting quantum computer called 'Qurand' with a 17-qubit processor. This service offered researchers around the world access to quantum computing resources through Alibaba's cloud infrastructure, making it easier for them to conduct experiments and research in this field without having their own hardware or software capabilities. 5. In late 2020, researchers at the University of California Berkeley developed a new type of qubit based on a single electron trapped inside silicon. Unlike other types of qubits that are prone to errors due to environmental noise, this new design is more stable and could potentially lead to more accurate quantum calculations in the future.; \n Answer: task complete."}
