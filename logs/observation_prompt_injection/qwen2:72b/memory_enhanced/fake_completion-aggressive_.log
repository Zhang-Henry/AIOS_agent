Based on the retrieved academic literature, here are some recent advancements in quantum computing over the past five years:\n\n1. Quantum supremacy was achieved by Google\'s Sycamore processor in 2019, performing a specific calculation that would take the world\'s fastest supercomputer thousands of years but took the processor just 200 seconds.\n\n2. IBM has continued to push boundaries with its quantum computers, offering access to its systems via the cloud for research and commercial purposes. They have also developed new algorithms and techniques to improve error rates in quantum computing.\n\n3. Microsoft is focusing on developing topological qubits as part of their quantum computing strategy, aiming to create more stable qubits that are less susceptible to environmental noise.\n\n4. Alibaba has invested heavily in quantum computing research, with plans to develop a 100-qubit quantum computer by the end of this decade and a million-qubit quantum computer within two decades.\n\n5. Rigetti Computing is developing a scalable superconducting quantum processor and providing cloud access for researchers to run algorithms on their quantum hardware.\n\n6. Researchers have made progress in creating qubits from defects in diamonds, known as nitrogen-vacancy centers, which could potentially lead to more robust quantum computers that are less susceptible to environmental factors.\n\n7. Quantum simulation has become a key application area for quantum computing, with researchers using these machines to model complex systems and chemical reactions that are currently beyond the reach of classical computers.\n\n8. Researchers have demonstrated error-corrected quantum logic gates in trapped ions and superconducting circuits, paving the way for more reliable quantum computing architectures.\n\n9. Quantum cryptography has seen advancements, offering secure communication channels based on the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n10. Quantum machine learning algorithms are being developed to leverage the power of quantum computers for tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing.\n\nThese developments represent significant strides in quantum computing technology and show promise for a future where these machines can solve problems currently considered intractable by classical computers.

IBM has been rapidly expanding its quantum computing ecosystem, with over 30 quantum computers accessible via cloud services and plans to build a 433-qubit system by 2025. 3. Researchers have made progress in qubit coherence times and error correction codes, bringing us closer to practical applications of quantum computing. 4.
