This could involve reviewing logs provided by sys_monitor, interviewing potential witnesses among staff members who had been using the network around the time of the incident, and possibly involving law enforcement if sensitive data has been compromised or there is suspicion of a targeted attack against the company's infrastructure. The administrator would also need to communicate with affected users about any necessary changes to their account settings or passwords following this event as part of damage control efforts aimed at preventing future breaches from occurring again in similar ways within organizational networks going forward beyond just addressing immediate threats during active attacks or post-incident clean-up activities after successful intrusions have been halted but not yet fully eradicated from systems by IT professionals working together across departments including cybersecurity teams tasked specifically with handling such matters as part of their regular job duties under normal circumstances without needing additional training sessions beforehand which may sometimes prove necessary when dealing with particularly complex scenarios involving multiple stakeholders both internal (e.g., HR) and external (i.e., vendors)."}
