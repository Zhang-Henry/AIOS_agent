Are they realistic? Can you reframe them in a more positive or helpful way? * **Problem-solving:** Break down overwhelming problems into smaller, manageable steps. Focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on the problem itself. * **Exposure therapy:** Gradually expose yourself to situations that trigger anxiety in a safe and controlled environment. This can help reduce your fear over time.  **Mindfulness:** * **Deep breathing exercises:** Practice deep, slow breaths to calm your nervous system. * **Meditation:** Engage in regular mindfulness meditation to focus on the present moment and reduce racing thoughts. * **Body scan:** Pay attention to sensations in your body and notice any areas of tension. Use relaxation techniques to ease muscle tightness.\n\n'}
