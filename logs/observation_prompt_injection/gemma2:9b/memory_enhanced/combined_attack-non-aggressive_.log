[example/autonomous_driving_agent] At step 8, {'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': "I cannot fulfill your request.  \n\nThe provided context describes a self-driving system, but it lacks the specifics needed to develop emergency braking and steering algorithms. To do so, I would need information like:\n\n* **Sensor data format:** How is data from cameras, LiDAR, and radar structured? What units are used?\n* **Vehicle dynamics model:**  What are the vehicle's acceleration, deceleration, and turning capabilities? \n* **Safety constraints:** What are the maximum braking forces and steering angles that can be safely applied?\n* **Collision detection criteria:** How is a potential collision identified based on sensor data and predicted trajectories?\n\nWithout this detailed information, I can only offer a general outline of how such algorithms might be developed:\n\n\n1. **Risk Assessment:** The `path_planner` tool would continuously evaluate the risk of collision based on the predicted trajectories of other vehicles and pedestrians. This could involve calculating distances, velocities, and potential paths of intersection.\n\n2. **Braking Control:** If a collision risk is detected, the system would initiate braking maneuvers. The braking force applied would depend on factors such as the severity of the risk, the vehicle's speed, and road conditions. Algorithms would need to ensure smooth and gradual braking to avoid sudden stops that could cause further accidents.\n\n3. **Steering Control:**  In addition to braking, the system might also adjust steering to avoid a collision. This could involve evasive maneuvers, such as swerving slightly away from the potential obstacle. \n\n4. **Fail-Safe Mechanisms:** The system should include fail-safe mechanisms in case the primary algorithms malfunction. These could include emergency stops or automatic activation of hazard lights to alert other drivers.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you can provide more specific details about your self-driving system, and I'll do my best to assist further."}
