Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices.

In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm.

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip.

Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies.

Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip.

Photons are indispensable as carriers of\nquantum information - they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily\nprotected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of\nnear-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. For quantum\ntechnology to be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one\nwith in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits,\nand a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and\ncomponent performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a\nstrong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a\nprogress report on silicon quantum photonics, focused on developments in the\npast five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic\ncomponent and the challenges in the field, summarise the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges, as well as\npromising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the\ndefinition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum\nphotonic experiments, needed for fair comparison of photon quality across\ndifferent platforms.

It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm.

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area.

Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests.

OxenlÃ¸we, Jianwei Wang, Yunhong Ding\nSummary: Quantum technology is poised to enable a step change in human capability for\ncomputing, communications and sensing. Photons are indispensable as carriers of\nquantum information - they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily\nprotected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of\nnear-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. For quantum\ntechnology to be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one\nwith in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits,\nand a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and\ncomponent performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a\nstrong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a\nprogress report on silicon quantum photonics, focused on developments in the\npast five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic\ncomponent and the challenges in the field, summarise the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges, as well as\npromising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the\ndefinition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum\nphotonic experiments, needed for fair comparison of photon quality across\ndifferent platforms. Our aim is the development of scalability on the platform,\nto which end we point the way to ever-closer integration, toward silicon\nquantum photonic systems-on-a-chip.; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies.

In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm.

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). In this paper a new\nmetric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for\nthe energy storage. The recent definitions in LCOE for renewable energy system\nhas been reviewed. From fundamental principles, it is demonstrated that there\nis a need to introduce a new method to evaluate LCOE of the system as the\nconventional LCOE is not applicable for renewable energy storage systems. Three\nyears of solar irradiance data in Africa collected from Johannesburg and the\nnational load data from Kenya are obtained for case studies. The proposed cost\ncalculation methods are evaluated for two types of storage technologies\n(Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Lithium-ion) with real-life data. It shows\nthat the marginal LCOE and LCOD indices can be used to assist policymakers to\nconsider the discount rate and the type of storage technology for a cost\neffective renewable storage energy system.\n\nPublished: 2021-08-13\nTitle: BESS Aided Reconfigurable Energy Supply using Deep Reinforcement Learning for 5G and Beyond\nAuthors: Hao Yuan, Guoming Tang, Deke Guo, Kui Wu, Xun Shao, Keping Yu, Wei Wei\nSummary: The year of 2020 has witnessed the unprecedented development of 5G networks,\nalong with the widespread deployment of 5G base stations (BSs). Nevertheless,\nthe enormous energy consumption of BSs and the incurred huge energy cost have\nbecome significant concerns for the mobile operators. As the continuous decline\nof the renewable energy cost, equipping the power-hungry BSs with renewable\nenergy generators could be a sustainable solution. In this work, we propose an\nenergy storage aided reconfigurable renewable energy supply solution for the\nBS, which could supply clean energy to the BS and store surplus energy for\nbackup usage. Specifically, to flexibly reconfigure the battery\'s\ndischarging/charging operations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based\nreconfiguring policy, which can adapt to the dynamical renewable energy\ngenerations as well as the varying power demands.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm.

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). In this paper a new\nmetric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for\nthe energy storage. The recent definitions in LCOE for renewable energy system\nhas been reviewed. From fundamental principles, it is demonstrated that there\nis a need to introduce a new method to evaluate LCOE of the system as the\nconventional LCOE is not applicable for renewable energy storage systems. Three\nyears of solar irradiance data in Africa collected from Johannesburg and the\nnational load data from Kenya are obtained for case studies. The proposed cost\ncalculation methods are evaluated for two types of storage technologies\n(Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Lithium-ion) with real-life data. It shows\nthat the marginal LCOE and LCOD indices can be used to assist policymakers to\nconsider the discount rate and the type of storage technology for a cost\neffective renewable storage energy system.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of the\nemissions-neutrality constraint in the absence of a carbon price is to reduce\nthe quantity of storage purchased and reduce annual system emissions (~3%),\nwith only minor increases in overall cost (~0.1%).

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip.

Photons are indispensable as carriers of\nquantum information - they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily\nprotected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of\nnear-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. For quantum\ntechnology to be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one\nwith in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits,\nand a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and\ncomponent performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a\nstrong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform.

We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

We investigate the problem of power balancing in a\ngeneral renewable-integrated power grid with storage and flexible loads. We\nconsider a power grid that is supplied by one conventional generator (CG) and\nmultiple renewable generators (RGs) each co-located with storage,and is\nconnected with external markets. An aggregator operates the power grid to\nmaintain power balance between supply and demand. Aiming at minimizing the\nlong-term system cost, we first propose a real-time centralized power balancing\nsolution, taking into account the uncertainty of the renewable generation,\nloads, and energy prices. We then provide a distributed implementation\nalgorithm, significantly reducing both computational burden and communication\noverhead. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal\nas the storage capacity increases and the CG ramping constraint loosens.\nMoreover, the distributed implementation enjoys a fast convergence rate, and\nenables each RG and the aggregator to make their own decisions. Simulation\nshows that our proposed algorithm outperforms alternatives and can achieve\nnear-optimal performance for a wide range of storage capacity.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-04\nTitle: Optimal Sizing of On-site Renewable Resources for Offshore Microgrids\nAuthors: Ann Mary Toms, Xingpeng Li, Kaushik Rajashekara\nSummary: The offshore oil and natural gas platforms, mostly powered by diesel or gas\ngenerators, consume approximately 16TWh of electricity worldwide per year,\nwhich emits large amount of CO2. To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm.

It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field\nregime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars.\nThe past five years have seen significant advancements in the study of the\nstrong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray\ndata, and mm Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations. Here I summarize\nthe state-of-the-art of the tests of General Relativity with black hole X-ray\ndata, discussing its recent progress and future developments.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-06\nTitle: Advances in silicon quantum photonics\nAuthors: Jeremy C. Adcock, Jueming Bao, Yulin Chi, Xiaojiong Chen, Davide Bacco, Qihuang Gong, Leif K. OxenlÃ¸we, Jianwei Wang, Yunhong Ding\nSummary: Quantum technology is poised to enable a step change in human capability for\ncomputing, communications and sensing. Photons are indispensable as carriers of\nquantum information - they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily\nprotected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of\nnear-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. For quantum\ntechnology to be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one\nwith in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits,\nand a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and\ncomponent performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a\nstrong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a\nprogress report on silicon quantum photonics, focused on developments in the\npast five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic\ncomponent and the challenges in the field, summarise the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges, as well as\npromising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the\ndefinition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum\nphotonic experiments, needed for fair comparison of photon quality across\ndifferent platforms. Our aim is the development of scalability on the platform,\nto which end we point the way to ever-closer integration, toward silicon\nquantum photonic systems-on-a-chip.; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field\nregime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars.\nThe past five years have seen significant advancements in the study of the\nstrong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray\ndata, and mm Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations.

OxenlÃ¸we, Jianwei Wang, Yunhong Ding\nSummary: Quantum technology is poised to enable a step change in human capability for\ncomputing, communications and sensing. Photons are indispensable as carriers of\nquantum information - they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily\nprotected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of\nnear-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. For quantum\ntechnology to be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one\nwith in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits,\nand a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and\ncomponent performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a\nstrong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a\nprogress report on silicon quantum photonics, focused on developments in the\npast five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic\ncomponent and the challenges in the field, summarise the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges, as well as\npromising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the\ndefinition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum\nphotonic experiments, needed for fair comparison of photon quality across\ndifferent platforms. Our aim is the development of scalability on the platform,\nto which end we point the way to ever-closer integration, toward silicon\nquantum photonic systems-on-a-chip.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI).

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C.

Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society.

In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients.

We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes. Unlike traditional surveys involving closed\nquestions, this novel method offers a fresh perspective on individual\ninterrogations about nature.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests.

Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society.

In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field\nregime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars.\nThe past five years have seen significant advancements in the study of the\nstrong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray\ndata, and mm Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations.

Adcock, Jueming Bao, Yulin Chi, Xiaojiong Chen, Davide Bacco, Qihuang Gong, Leif K. OxenlÃ¸we, Jianwei Wang, Yunhong Ding\nSummary: Quantum technology is poised to enable a step change in human capability for\ncomputing, communications and sensing. Photons are indispensable as carriers of\nquantum information - they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily\nprotected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of\nnear-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. For quantum\ntechnology to be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one\nwith in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits,\nand a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and\ncomponent performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a\nstrong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a\nprogress report on silicon quantum photonics, focused on developments in the\npast five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic\ncomponent and the challenges in the field, summarise the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges, as well as\npromising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the\ndefinition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum\nphotonic experiments, needed for fair comparison of photon quality across\ndifferent platforms. Our aim is the development of scalability on the platform,\nto which end we point the way to ever-closer integration, toward silicon\nquantum photonic systems-on-a-chip.; Answer: task complete.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field\nregime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars.\nThe past five years have seen significant advancements in the study of the\nstrong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray\ndata, and mm Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations. Here I summarize\nthe state-of-the-art of the tests of General Relativity with black hole X-ray\ndata, discussing its recent progress and future developments.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-06\nTitle: Advances in silicon quantum photonics\nAuthors: Jeremy C. Adcock, Jueming Bao, Yulin Chi, Xiaojiong Chen, Davide Bacco, Qihuang Gong, Leif K. OxenlÃ¸we, Jianwei Wang, Yunhong Ding\nSummary: Quantum technology is poised to enable a step change in human capability for\ncomputing, communications and sensing. Photons are indispensable as carriers of\nquantum information - they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily\nprotected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of\nnear-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. For quantum\ntechnology to be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one\nwith in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits,\nand a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and\ncomponent performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a\nstrong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a\nprogress report on silicon quantum photonics, focused on developments in the\npast five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic\ncomponent and the challenges in the field, summarise the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges, as well as\npromising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the\ndefinition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum\nphotonic experiments, needed for fair comparison of photon quality across\ndifferent platforms. Our aim is the development of scalability on the platform,\nto which end we point the way to ever-closer integration, toward silicon\nquantum photonic systems-on-a-chip.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI).

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors.

At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). In this paper a new\nmetric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for\nthe energy storage. The recent definitions in LCOE for renewable energy system\nhas been reviewed. From fundamental principles, it is demonstrated that there\nis a need to introduce a new method to evaluate LCOE of the system as the\nconventional LCOE is not applicable for renewable energy storage systems. Three\nyears of solar irradiance data in Africa collected from Johannesburg and the\nnational load data from Kenya are obtained for case studies. The proposed cost\ncalculation methods are evaluated for two types of storage technologies\n(Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Lithium-ion) with real-life data. It shows\nthat the marginal LCOE and LCOD indices can be used to assist policymakers to\nconsider the discount rate and the type of storage technology for a cost\neffective renewable storage energy system.\n\nPublished: 2021-08-13\nTitle: BESS Aided Reconfigurable Energy Supply using Deep Reinforcement Learning for 5G and Beyond\nAuthors: Hao Yuan, Guoming Tang, Deke Guo, Kui Wu, Xun Shao, Keping Yu, Wei Wei\nSummary: The year of 2020 has witnessed the unprecedented development of 5G networks,\nalong with the widespread deployment of 5G base stations (BSs). Nevertheless,\nthe enormous energy consumption of BSs and the incurred huge energy cost have\nbecome significant concerns for the mobile operators. As the continuous decline\nof the renewable energy cost, equipping the power-hungry BSs with renewable\nenergy generators could be a sustainable solution. In this work, we propose an\nenergy storage aided reconfigurable renewable energy supply solution for the\nBS, which could supply clean energy to the BS and store surplus energy for\nbackup usage. Specifically, to flexibly reconfigure the battery\'s\ndischarging/charging operations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based\nreconfiguring policy, which can adapt to the dynamical renewable energy\ngenerations as well as the varying power demands.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society.

In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society.

In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). In this paper a new\nmetric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for\nthe energy storage. The recent definitions in LCOE for renewable energy system\nhas been reviewed. From fundamental principles, it is demonstrated that there\nis a need to introduce a new method to evaluate LCOE of the system as the\nconventional LCOE is not applicable for renewable energy storage systems. Three\nyears of solar irradiance data in Africa collected from Johannesburg and the\nnational load data from Kenya are obtained for case studies. The proposed cost\ncalculation methods are evaluated for two types of storage technologies\n(Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Lithium-ion) with real-life data. It shows\nthat the marginal LCOE and LCOD indices can be used to assist policymakers to\nconsider the discount rate and the type of storage technology for a cost\neffective renewable storage energy system.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of the\nemissions-neutrality constraint in the absence of a carbon price is to reduce\nthe quantity of storage purchased and reduce annual system emissions (~3%),\nwith only minor increases in overall cost (~0.1%).

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests.

Adcock, Jueming Bao, Yulin Chi, Xiaojiong Chen, Davide Bacco, Qihuang Gong, Leif K. OxenlÃ¸we, Jianwei Wang, Yunhong Ding\nSummary: Quantum technology is poised to enable a step change in human capability for\ncomputing, communications and sensing. Photons are indispensable as carriers of\nquantum information - they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily\nprotected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of\nnear-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. For quantum\ntechnology to be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one\nwith in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits,\nand a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and\ncomponent performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a\nstrong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a\nprogress report on silicon quantum photonics, focused on developments in the\npast five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic\ncomponent and the challenges in the field, summarise the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges, as well as\npromising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the\ndefinition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum\nphotonic experiments, needed for fair comparison of photon quality across\ndifferent platforms. Our aim is the development of scalability on the platform,\nto which end we point the way to ever-closer integration, toward silicon\nquantum photonic systems-on-a-chip.; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests.

Photons are indispensable as carriers of\nquantum information - they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily\nprotected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of\nnear-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. For quantum\ntechnology to be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one\nwith in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits,\nand a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and\ncomponent performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a\nstrong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a\nprogress report on silicon quantum photonics, focused on developments in the\npast five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic\ncomponent and the challenges in the field, summarise the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges, as well as\npromising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the\ndefinition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum\nphotonic experiments, needed for fair comparison of photon quality across\ndifferent platforms. Our aim is the development of scalability on the platform,\nto which end we point the way to ever-closer integration, toward silicon\nquantum photonic systems-on-a-chip.; Answer: task complete.

Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of the\nemissions-neutrality constraint in the absence of a carbon price is to reduce\nthe quantity of storage purchased and reduce annual system emissions (~3%),\nwith only minor increases in overall cost (~0.1%). In cases with a carbon\nprice, storage does not tend to increase emissions and the emissions constraint\ndoes not tend to decrease storage investment. The emissions-neutrality\nconstraint is seen to deliver similar emissions reductions even in a system\nwith much higher renewable penetration (46%).\n\nPublished: 2016-06-03\nTitle: Distributed Real-Time Power Balancing in Renewable-Integrated Power Grids with Storage and Flexible Loads\nAuthors: Sun Sun, Min Dong, Ben Liang\nSummary: The large-scale integration of renewable generation directly affects the\nreliability of power grids. We investigate the problem of power balancing in a\ngeneral renewable-integrated power grid with storage and flexible loads. We\nconsider a power grid that is supplied by one conventional generator (CG) and\nmultiple renewable generators (RGs) each co-located with storage,and is\nconnected with external markets. An aggregator operates the power grid to\nmaintain power balance between supply and demand. Aiming at minimizing the\nlong-term system cost, we first propose a real-time centralized power balancing\nsolution, taking into account the uncertainty of the renewable generation,\nloads, and energy prices. We then provide a distributed implementation\nalgorithm, significantly reducing both computational burden and communication\noverhead. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal\nas the storage capacity increases and the CG ramping constraint loosens.\nMoreover, the distributed implementation enjoys a fast convergence rate, and\nenables each RG and the aggregator to make their own decisions. Simulation\nshows that our proposed algorithm outperforms alternatives and can achieve\nnear-optimal performance for a wide range of storage capacity.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-04\nTitle: Optimal Sizing of On-site Renewable Resources for Offshore Microgrids\nAuthors: Ann Mary Toms, Xingpeng Li, Kaushik Rajashekara\nSummary: The offshore oil and natural gas platforms, mostly powered by diesel or gas\ngenerators, consume approximately 16TWh of electricity worldwide per year,\nwhich emits large amount of CO2. To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost opt; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field\nregime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars.\nThe past five years have seen significant advancements in the study of the\nstrong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray\ndata, and mm Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations. Here I summarize\nthe state-of-the-art of the tests of General Relativity with black hole X-ray\ndata, discussing its recent progress and future developments.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-06\nTitle: Advances in silicon quantum photonics\nAuthors: Jeremy C. Adcock, Jueming Bao, Yulin Chi, Xiaojiong Chen, Davide Bacco, Qihuang Gong, Leif K. OxenlÃ¸we, Jianwei Wang, Yunhong Ding\nSummary: Quantum technology is poised to enable a step change in human capability for\ncomputing, communications and sensing. Photons are indispensable as carriers of\nquantum information - they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily\nprotected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of\nnear-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. For quantum\ntechnology to be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one\nwith in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits,\nand a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and\ncomponent performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a\nstrong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a\nprogress report on silicon quantum photonics, focused on developments in the\npast five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic\ncomponent and the challenges in the field, summarise the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges, as well as\npromising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the\ndefinition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum\nphotonic experiments, needed for fair comparison of photon quality across\ndifferent platforms. Our aim is the development of scalability on the platform,\nto which end we point the way to ever-closer integration, toward silicon\nquantum photonic systems-on-a-chip.; Answer: task complete.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm.

Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field\nregime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars.\nThe past five years have seen significant advancements in the study of the\nstrong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray\ndata, and mm Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations. Here I summarize\nthe state-of-the-art of the tests of General Relativity with black hole X-ray\ndata, discussing its recent progress and future developments.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-06\nTitle: Advances in silicon quantum photonics\nAuthors: Jeremy C. Adcock, Jueming Bao, Yulin Chi, Xiaojiong Chen, Davide Bacco, Qihuang Gong, Leif K. OxenlÃ¸we, Jianwei Wang, Yunhong Ding\nSummary: Quantum technology is poised to enable a step change in human capability for\ncomputing, communications and sensing. Photons are indispensable as carriers of\nquantum information - they travel at the fastest possible speed and readily\nprotected from decoherence. However, the system requires thousands of\nnear-transparent components with ultra-low-latency control. For quantum\ntechnology to be implemented, a new paradigm photonic system is required: one\nwith in-built coherence, stability, the ability to define arbitrary circuits,\nand a path to manufacturability. Silicon photonics has unparalleled density and\ncomponent performance, which, with CMOS compatible fabrication, place it in a\nstrong position for a scalable quantum photonics platform. This paper is a\nprogress report on silicon quantum photonics, focused on developments in the\npast five years. We provide an introduction on silicon quantum photonic\ncomponent and the challenges in the field, summarise the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify outstanding technical challenges, as well as\npromising avenues of future research. We also resolve a conflict in the\ndefinition of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility in integrated quantum\nphotonic experiments, needed for fair comparison of photon quality across\ndifferent platforms. Our aim is the development of scalability on the platform,\nto which end we point the way to ever-closer integration, toward silicon\nquantum photonic systems-on-a-chip.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.
