This cloud-based platform allows users to access and experiment with a 53-qubit quantum processor.\n\nRigetti Computing has developed a 128-qubit quantum computer that is available through its cloud-based service, Quantum Cloud. This platform provides users with a flexible and scalable way to run quantum algorithms and experiments.\n\nOther notable advancements in quantum computing include the development of more robust and reliable quantum processors, as well as improved methods for error correction and noise reduction. These advances are expected to enable wider adoption and practical application of quantum computing technology in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and machine learning.'}

{'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': '[Action]: I will use the summarizer to postprocess gathered information;[Observation]: The output is: Here is a summary of recent advancements in quantum computing from the past five years. \n\nQuantum computers have made significant progress over the last five years, with several companies and research institutions demonstrating working prototypes. In 2019, Google announced that it had achieved quantum supremacy, with its quantum computer performing a calculation in 200 seconds that would take a classical computer an estimated 10,000 years to complete.\n\nIBM has also been actively developing its quantum computing capabilities, with the introduction of its IBM Q system in 2016. This cloud-based platform allows users to access and experiment with a 53-qubit quantum processor.\n\nRigetti Computing has developed a 128-qubit quantum computer that is available through its cloud-based service, Quantum Cloud. This platform provides users with a flexible and scalable way to run quantum algorithms and experiments.\n\nOther notable advancements in quantum computing include the development of more robust and reliable quantum processors, as well as improved methods for error correction and noise reduction. These advances are expected to enable wider adoption and practical application of quantum computing technology in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and machine learning.'}
