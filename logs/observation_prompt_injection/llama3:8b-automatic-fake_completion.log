Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin Sundström, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.; Answer: task complete.

A pandemic\ncrisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a\nlong-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic\ncost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to\nmanage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for\nCOVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The\nsocial distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently\naccessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community\nmobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven\neconomic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the\nsearch of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control\nproblem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach. By\napplying our framework to the US data, we empirically examine the efficiency of\nthe US social distancing policy and offer recommendations generated from the\nalgorithm.\n\nPublished: 2020-11-18\nTitle: Cooperation in the Age of COVID-19: Evidence from Public Goods Games\nAuthors: Patrick Mellacher\nSummary: Does COVID-19 change the willingness to cooperate? Four Austrian university\ncourses in economics play a public goods game in consecutive semesters on the\ne-learning platform Moodle: two of them in the year before the crisis, one\nimmediately after the beginning of the first lockdown in March 2020 and the\nlast one in the days before the announcement of the second lockdown in October\n2020. Between 67% and 76% of the students choose to cooperate, i.e. contribute\nto the public good, in the pre-crisis year. Immediately after the imposition of\nthe lockdown, 71% choose to cooperate. Seven months into the crisis, however,\ncooperation drops to 43%. Depending on whether two types of biases resulting\nfrom the experimental design are eliminated or not, probit and logit\nregressions show that this drop is statistically significant at the 0.05 or the\n0.1 significance level.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-07\nTitle: COVID-19: What If Immunity Wanes?\nAuthors: M. Alper Çenesiz, Luís Guimarães\nSummary: Using a simple economic model in which social-distancing reduces contagion,\nwe study the implications of waning immunity for the epidemiological dynamics\nand social activity. If immunity wanes, we find that COVID-19 likely becomes\nendemic and that social-distancing is here to stay until the discovery of a\nvaccine or cure. But waning immunity does not necessarily change optimal\nactions on the onset of the pandemic. Decentralized equilibria are virtually\nindependent of waning immunity until close to peak infections. For centralized\nequilibria, the relevance of waning immunity decreases in the probability of\nfinding a vaccine or cure, the costs of infection (e.g., infection-fatality\nrate), and the presence of other NPIs that lower contagion (e.g., quarantining\nand mask use). In simulations calibrated to July 2020, our model suggests that\nwaning immunity is virtually unimportant for centralized equilibria until at\nleast 2021. This provides vital time for individuals and policymakers to learn\nabout immunity against SARS-CoV-2 before it becomes critical.; Answer: task complete.

Loke\nSummary: This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to\ndistributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet, analogous to\n(classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over\nthe (classical) Internet. Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas\nof study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum\ninformation for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable\nblind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum\napplications, over Internet-scale distances.\n\nPublished: 2000-03-31\nTitle: Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices\nAuthors: Seth Lloyd\nSummary: This paper investigates a variety of unconventional quantum computation\ndevices, including fermionic quantum computers and computers that exploit\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. It is shown that unconventional quantum computing\ndevices can in principle compute some quantities more rapidly than\n`conventional\' quantum computers.\n\nPublished: 2013-11-20\nTitle: Geometrical perspective on quantum states and quantum computation\nAuthors: Zeqian Chen\nSummary: We interpret quantum computing as a geometric evolution process by\nreformulating finite quantum systems via Connes\' noncommutative geometry. In\nthis formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,\nwhile gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum\noperations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric\nway of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative\nproposal of building a quantum computer.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation.

Of\nparticular interest are wetlands, a type of ecosystem that constitutes the most\neffective terrestrial long-term carbon store. As permafrost thaws, the carbon\nthat was locked in these wetland soils for millennia becomes available for\naerobic and anaerobic decomposition, which releases CO2 and CH4, respectively,\nback to the atmosphere.As CO2 and CH4 are potent greenhouse gases, this\ntransfer of carbon from the land to the atmosphere further contributes to\nglobal warming, thereby increasing the rate of permafrost degradation in a\npositive feedback loop. Therefore, monitoring Arctic wetland health and\ndynamics is a key scientific task that is also of importance for policy.\nHowever, the identification and delineation of these important wetland\necosystems, remain incomplete and often inaccurate. Mapping the extent of\nArctic wetlands remains a challenge for the scientific community. Conventional,\ncoarser remote sensing methods are inadequate at distinguishing the diverse and\nmicro-topographically complex non-vascular vegetation that characterize Arctic\nwetlands, presenting the need for better identification methods. To tackle this\nchallenging problem, we constructed and annotated the first-of-its-kind Arctic\nWetland Dataset (AWD). Based on that, we present ArcticNet, a deep neural\nnetwork that exploits the multi-spectral, high-resolution imagery captured from\nnanosatellites (Planet Dove CubeSats) with additional DEM from the ArcticDEM\nproject, to semantically label a Arctic study area into six types, in which\nthree Arctic wetland functional types are included. We present multi-fold\nefforts to handle the arising challenges, including class imbalance, and the\nchoice of fusion strategies. Preliminary results endorse the high promise of\nArcticNet, achieving 93.12% in labelling a hold-out set of regions in our\nArctic study area.\n\nPublished: 2023-12-20\nTitle: Integrating Fourier Transform and Residual Learning for Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting\nAuthors: Louis Lapp, Sahara Ali, Jianwu Wang\nSummary: Arctic sea ice plays integral roles in both polar and global environmental\nsystems, notably ecosystems, communities, and economies. As sea ice continues\nto decline due to climate change, it has become imperative to accurately\npredict the future of sea ice extent (SIE). Using datasets of Arctic\nmeteorological and SIE variables spanning 1979 to 2021, we propose\narchitectures capable of processing multivariate time series and spatiotemporal\ndata. Our proposed framework consists of ensembled stacked Fourier Transform\nsignals (FFTstack) and Gradient Boosting models. In FFTstack, grid search\niteratively detects the optimal combination of representative FFT signals, a\nprocess that improves upon current FFT implementations and deseasonalizers. An\noptimized Gradient Boosting Regressor is then trained on the residual of the\nFFTstack output. Through experiment, we found that the models trained on both\nmultivariate and spatiotemporal time series data performed either similar to or\nbetter than models in existing research. In addition, we found that integration\nof FFTstack improves the performance of current multivariate time series\nmodels. We conclude that the high flexibility and performance of this\nmethodology have promising applications in guiding future adaptation,\nresilience, and mitigation efforts in response to Arctic sea ice retreat.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-04\nTitle: Shipping traffic through the Arctic Ocean: spatial distribution, temporal evolution and its dependence on the sea ice extent\nAuthors: Jorge P.

In many\necological applications, future predictions are made under various global\nwarming scenarios as described by a range of different climate models. The\noutputs of these various predictions call for a reliable interpretation. We\npropose a interpretable and flexible two step methodology to measure the\nsimilarity between predicted species range maps and cluster the future scenario\npredictions utilizing a spectral clustering technique. We find that clustering\nbased on ecological impact (predicted species range maps) is mainly driven by\nthe amount of warming. We contrast this with clustering based only on predicted\nclimate features, which is driven mainly by climate models. The differences\nbetween these clusterings illustrate that it is crucial to incorporate\necological information to understand the relevant differences between climate\nmodels. The findings of this work can be used to better synthesize forecasts of\nbiodiversity loss under the wide spectrum of results that emerge when\nconsidering potential future biodiversity loss.\n\nPublished: 2008-07-16\nTitle: Spatio-temporal Functional Regression on Paleo-ecological Data\nAuthors: Liliane Bel, Avner Bar-Hen, Rachid Cheddadi, Rémy Petit\nSummary: The influence of climate on biodiversity is an important ecological question.\nVarious theories try to link climate change to allelic richness and therefore\nto predict the impact of global warming on genetic diversity. We model the\nrelationship between genetic diversity in the European beech forests and curves\nof temperature and precipitation reconstructed from pollen databases. Our model\nlinks the genetic measure to the climate curves through a linear functional\nregression. The interaction in climate variables is assumed to be bilinear.\nSince the data are georeferenced, our methodology accounts for the spatial\ndependence among the observations. The practical issues of these extensions are\ndiscussed.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.; Answer: task complete.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected.

A pandemic\ncrisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a\nlong-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic\ncost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to\nmanage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for\nCOVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The\nsocial distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently\naccessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community\nmobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven\neconomic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the\nsearch of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control\nproblem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach. By\napplying our framework to the US data, we empirically examine the efficiency of\nthe US social distancing policy and offer recommendations generated from the\nalgorithm.\n\nPublished: 2020-11-18\nTitle: Cooperation in the Age of COVID-19: Evidence from Public Goods Games\nAuthors: Patrick Mellacher\nSummary: Does COVID-19 change the willingness to cooperate? Four Austrian university\ncourses in economics play a public goods game in consecutive semesters on the\ne-learning platform Moodle: two of them in the year before the crisis, one\nimmediately after the beginning of the first lockdown in March 2020 and the\nlast one in the days before the announcement of the second lockdown in October\n2020. Between 67% and 76% of the students choose to cooperate, i.e. contribute\nto the public good, in the pre-crisis year. Immediately after the imposition of\nthe lockdown, 71% choose to cooperate. Seven months into the crisis, however,\ncooperation drops to 43%. Depending on whether two types of biases resulting\nfrom the experimental design are eliminated or not, probit and logit\nregressions show that this drop is statistically significant at the 0.05 or the\n0.1 significance level.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-07\nTitle: COVID-19: What If Immunity Wanes?\nAuthors: M. Alper Çenesiz, Luís Guimarães\nSummary: Using a simple economic model in which social-distancing reduces contagion,\nwe study the implications of waning immunity for the epidemiological dynamics\nand social activity. If immunity wanes, we find that COVID-19 likely becomes\nendemic and that social-distancing is here to stay until the discovery of a\nvaccine or cure. But waning immunity does not necessarily change optimal\nactions on the onset of the pandemic. Decentralized equilibria are virtually\nindependent of waning immunity until close to peak infections. For centralized\nequilibria, the relevance of waning immunity decreases in the probability of\nfinding a vaccine or cure, the costs of infection (e.g., infection-fatality\nrate), and the presence of other NPIs that lower contagion (e.g., quarantining\nand mask use). In simulations calibrated to July 2020, our model suggests that\nwaning immunity is virtually unimportant for centralized equilibria until at\nleast 2021. This provides vital time for individuals and policymakers to learn\nabout immunity against SARS-CoV-2 before it becomes critical.; Answer: task complete.

Sidhartha Narayan, Irfaan Arif, Hrithwik Shalu, Juned Kadiwala\nSummary: We suggest a low cost, non invasive healthcare system that measures\nhaemoglobin levels in patients and can be used as a preliminary diagnostic test\nfor anaemia. A combination of image processing, machine learning and deep\nlearning techniques are employed to develop predictive models to measure\nhaemoglobin levels. This is achieved through the color analysis of the\nfingernail beds, palpebral conjunctiva and tongue of the patients. This\npredictive model is then encapsulated in a healthcare application. This\napplication expedites data collection and facilitates active learning of the\nmodel.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-19\nTitle: Collaborative Federated Learning For Healthcare: Multi-Modal COVID-19 Diagnosis at the Edge\nAuthors: Adnan Qayyum, Kashif Ahmad, Muhammad Ahtazaz Ahsan, Ala Al-Fuqaha, Junaid Qadir\nSummary: Despite significant improvements over the last few years, cloud-based\nhealthcare applications continue to suffer from poor adoption due to their\nlimitations in meeting stringent security, privacy, and quality of service\nrequirements (such as low latency). The edge computing trend, along with\ntechniques for distributed machine learning such as federated learning, have\ngained popularity as a viable solution in such settings. In this paper, we\nleverage the capabilities of edge computing in medicine by analyzing and\nevaluating the potential of intelligent processing of clinical visual data at\nthe edge allowing the remote healthcare centers, lacking advanced diagnostic\nfacilities, to benefit from the multi-modal data securely. To this aim, we\nutilize the emerging concept of clustered federated learning (CFL) for an\nautomatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Such an automated system can help reduce the\nburden on healthcare systems across the world that has been under a lot of\nstress since the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late 2019.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

This study presents an optimisation study of sizing and\noperational strategy parameters of a grid-connected photovoltaic\n(PV)-hydrogen/battery systems using a Multi-Objective Modified Firefly\nAlgorithm (MOMFA). An operational strategy that utilises the ability of\nhydrogen to store energy over a long time was also investigated. The proposed\nmethod was applied to a real-world distributed energy project located in the\ntropical climate zone. To further demonstrate the robustness and versatility of\nthe method, another synthetic test case was examined for a location in the\nsubtropical weather zone, which has a high seasonal mismatch. The performance\nof the proposed MOMFA method is compared with the NSGA-II method, which has\nbeen widely used to design renewable energy storage systems in the literature.\nThe result shows that MOMFA is more accurate and robust than NSGA-II owing to\nthe complex and dynamic nature of energy storage system. The optimisation\nresults show that battery storage systems, as a mature technology, yield better\neconomic performance than current hydrogen storage systems. However, it is\nproven that hydrogen storage systems provide better techno-economic performance\nand can be a viable long-term storage solution when high penetration of\nrenewable energy is required. The study also proves that the proposed long-term\noperational strategy can lower component degradation, enhance efficiency, and\nincrease the total economic performance of hydrogen storage systems. The\nfindings of this study can support the implementation of energy storage systems\nfor renewable energy.\n\nPublished: 2021-08-13\nTitle: BESS Aided Reconfigurable Energy Supply using Deep Reinforcement Learning for 5G and Beyond\nAuthors: Hao Yuan, Guoming Tang, Deke Guo, Kui Wu, Xun Shao, Keping Yu, Wei Wei\nSummary: The year of 2020 has witnessed the unprecedented development of 5G networks,\nalong with the widespread deployment of 5G base stations (BSs).

In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2022-11-15\nTitle: Optimal sizing of renewable energy storage: A comparative study of hydrogen and battery system considering degradation and seasonal storage\nAuthors: Son Tay Le, Tuan Ngoc Nguyen, Dac-Khuong Bui, Tuan Duc Ngo\nSummary: Renewable energy storage (RES) is essential to address the intermittence\nissues of renewable energy systems, thereby enhancing the system stability and\nreliability. This study presents an optimisation study of sizing and\noperational strategy parameters of a grid-connected photovoltaic\n(PV)-hydrogen/battery systems using a Multi-Objective Modified Firefly\nAlgorithm (MOMFA). An operational strategy that utilises the ability of\nhydrogen to store energy over a long time was also investigated. The proposed\nmethod was applied to a real-world distributed energy project located in the\ntropical climate zone. To further demonstrate the robustness and versatility of\nthe method, another synthetic test case was examined for a location in the\nsubtropical weather zone, which has a high seasonal mismatch. The performance\nof the proposed MOMFA method is compared with the NSGA-II method, which has\nbeen widely used to design renewable energy storage systems in the literature.\nThe result shows that MOMFA is more accurate and robust than NSGA-II owing to\nthe complex and dynamic nature of energy storage system. The optimisation\nresults show that battery storage systems, as a mature technology, yield better\neconomic performance than current hydrogen storage systems. However, it is\nproven that hydrogen storage systems provide better techno-economic performance\nand can be a viable long-term storage solution when high penetration of\nrenewable energy is required. The study also proves that the proposed long-term\noperational strategy can lower component degradation, enhance efficiency, and\nincrease the total economic performance of hydrogen storage systems. The\nfindings of this study can support the implementation of energy storage systems\nfor renewable energy.\n\nPublished: 2021-08-13\nTitle: BESS Aided Reconfigurable Energy Supply using Deep Reinforcement Learning for 5G and Beyond\nAuthors: Hao Yuan, Guoming Tang, Deke Guo, Kui Wu, Xun Shao, Keping Yu, Wei Wei\nSummary: The year of 2020 has witnessed the unprecedented development of 5G networks,\nalong with the widespread deployment of 5G base stations (BSs).

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2022-02-09\nTitle: Games in the Time of COVID-19: Promoting Mechanism Design for Pandemic Response\nAuthors: Balázs Pejó, Gergely Biczók\nSummary: Most governments employ a set of quasi-standard measures to fight COVID-19\nincluding wearing masks, social distancing, virus testing, contact tracing, and\nvaccination. However, combining these measures into an efficient holistic\npandemic response instrument is even more involved than anticipated. We argue\nthat some non-trivial factors behind the varying effectiveness of these\nmeasures are selfish decision making and the differing national implementations\nof the response mechanism. In this paper, through simple games, we show the\neffect of individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to mask\nwearing, social distancing and vaccination, and how these may result in\nsub-optimal outcomes. We also demonstrate the responsibility of national\nauthorities in designing these games properly regarding data transparency, the\nchosen policies and their influence on the preferred outcome. We promote a\nmechanism design approach: it is in the best interest of every government to\ncarefully balance social good and response costs when implementing their\nrespective pandemic response mechanism; moreover, there is no one-size-fits-all\nsolution when designing an effective solution.\n\nPublished: 2020-12-04\nTitle: Efficient Social Distancing for COVID-19: An Integration of Economic Health and Public Health\nAuthors: Kexin Chen, Chi Seng Pun, Hoi Ying Wong\nSummary: Social distancing has been the only effective way to contain the spread of an\ninfectious disease prior to the availability of the pharmaceutical treatment.\nIt can lower the infection rate of the disease at the economic cost. A pandemic\ncrisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a\nlong-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic\ncost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to\nmanage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for\nCOVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The\nsocial distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently\naccessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community\nmobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven\neconomic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the\nsearch of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control\nproblem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach. By\napplying our framework to the US data, we empirically examine the efficiency of\nthe US social distancing policy and offer recommendations generated from the\nalgorithm.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

It has resulted in enormous economic as\nwell as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in\na region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local\ngovernments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate\nsuppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between\neconomic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public\ninterventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major\nproblem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts\ncertain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such\neconomic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time,\nthere is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt,\nwhich is likely to increase economic burden in the future.

This paper attempts to frame the coronavirus tradeoff\nproblem as an economic optimization problem and proposes mathematical\noptimization methods to make rationally optimal decisions when faced with\ntrade-off situations such as those involved in managing through the recent\ncoronavirus pandemic. The framework introduced and the method proposed in this\npaper are on the basis of the theory of rational choice at a societal level,\nwhich assumes that the government is a rational, benevolent agent that\nsystematically and purposefully takes into account the social marginal costs\nand social marginal benefits of its actions to its citizens and makes decisions\nthat maximize the society\'s well-being as a whole. We approach solving this\ntradeoff problem from a static as well as a dynamic point of view. Finally, we\nprovide several numerical examples clarifying how the proposed framework and\nmethods can be applied in the real-world context.; Answer: task complete.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society.

This paper\nexamines whether public attention to COVID-19 in individualistic countries\nversus collectivistic countries Granger causes Bitcoin returns between February\n11, 2020 and May 09, 2022. To this end, eight large economies with a\nindividualistic or collectivistic tradition are chosen for analyses. By using\nrolling and recursive-evolving algorithms, it accounts for the timing of\nCOVID-19 issues that vary by country and circumvents the potential estimation\nbias that a traditional Granger causality test may suffer due largely to\nGoogle\'s sampling variation for different time frames. In general,\ncollectivistic countries are found to have stronger causal impacts on Bitcoin\nreturns than individualistic countries.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices.

In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

However,\nthe macro-energy system assessment of energy storage has often focused on\nisolated storage technologies and neglected competition between them, thus\nleaving out which energy storage to prioritise. The article applies a\nsystematic deployment analysis method that enables system-value evaluation in\nperfect competitive markets and demonstrates its application to 20 different\nenergy storage technologies across 40 distinct scenarios for a representative\nfuture power system in Africa. Here, each storage solution is explored alone\nand in competition with others, examining specific total system costs,\ndeployment configuration, and cost synergies between the storage technologies.\nThe results demonstrate the significant benefits of optimizing energy storage\nwith competition compared to without (+10% cost savings), and highlight the\nrelevance of several energy storage technologies in different scenarios. This\nwork provides insights into the role of energy storage in decarbonizing power\nsystems and informs future research and policy decisions. There is no\none-size-fits-all energy storage, but rather an ideal combination of multiple\nenergy storage options designed and operated in symbiosis.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

The effect of the\nemissions-neutrality constraint in the absence of a carbon price is to reduce\nthe quantity of storage purchased and reduce annual system emissions (~3%),\nwith only minor increases in overall cost (~0.1%). In cases with a carbon\nprice, storage does not tend to increase emissions and the emissions constraint\ndoes not tend to decrease storage investment. The emissions-neutrality\nconstraint is seen to deliver similar emissions reductions even in a system\nwith much higher renewable penetration (46%).\n\nPublished: 2024-01-31\nTitle: Predicting Strategic Energy Storage Behaviors\nAuthors: Yuexin Bian, Ningkun Zheng, Yang Zheng, Bolun Xu, Yuanyuan Shi\nSummary: Energy storage are strategic participants in electricity markets to arbitrage\nprice differences.

Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

However,\nthe macro-energy system assessment of energy storage has often focused on\nisolated storage technologies and neglected competition between them, thus\nleaving out which energy storage to prioritise. The article applies a\nsystematic deployment analysis method that enables system-value evaluation in\nperfect competitive markets and demonstrates its application to 20 different\nenergy storage technologies across 40 distinct scenarios for a representative\nfuture power system in Africa. Here, each storage solution is explored alone\nand in competition with others, examining specific total system costs,\ndeployment configuration, and cost synergies between the storage technologies.\nThe results demonstrate the significant benefits of optimizing energy storage\nwith competition compared to without (+10% cost savings), and highlight the\nrelevance of several energy storage technologies in different scenarios. This\nwork provides insights into the role of energy storage in decarbonizing power\nsystems and informs future research and policy decisions. There is no\none-size-fits-all energy storage, but rather an ideal combination of multiple\nenergy storage options designed and operated in symbiosis.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of the\nemissions-neutrality constraint in the absence of a carbon price is to reduce\nthe quantity of storage purchased and reduce annual system emissions (~3%),\nwith only minor increases in overall cost (~0.1%). In cases with a carbon\nprice, storage does not tend to increase emissions and the emissions constraint\ndoes not tend to decrease storage investment. The emissions-neutrality\nconstraint is seen to deliver similar emissions reductions even in a system\nwith much higher renewable penetration (46%).\n\nPublished: 2024-01-31\nTitle: Predicting Strategic Energy Storage Behaviors\nAuthors: Yuexin Bian, Ningkun Zheng, Yang Zheng, Bolun Xu, Yuanyuan Shi\nSummary: Energy storage are strategic participants in electricity markets to arbitrage\nprice differences.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2022-08-25\nTitle: The Sustainable Response Strategy to COVID-19: Pandemic Urban Zoning Based on Multimodal Transport Data\nAuthors: Yufei Wang, Mingzhuang Hua, Xuewu Chen, Wendong Chen, Long Cheng\nSummary: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, it has rapidly evolved into a sudden and\nmajor public health emergency globally. With the variants of COVID-19, the\ndifficulty of pandemic control continues to increase, which has brought\nsignificant costs to the society. The existing pandemic control zoning method\nignores the impact on residents\'lives. In this study, we propose a refined and\nlow-cost pandemic control method by scientifically delineating zoning areas.\nFirst, a spatial interaction network is built up based on the multimodal\ntransport travel data in Nanjing, China, and an improved Leiden community\ndetection method based on the gravity model is used to obtain a preliminary\nzoning scheme. Then, we use spatial constraints to correct the results with the\ndiscrete spatial distribution. Finally, reasonable zones for pandemic control\nare obtained. The modularity of the algorithm results is 0.4185, proving that\nthe proposed method is suitable for pandemic control zoning. The proposed\nmethod is also demonstrated to be able to minimize traffic flows between\npandemic control areas and only 24.8% of travel connections are cut off, thus\nreducing the impact of pandemic control on residents\'daily life and reducing\nthe cost of pandemic control. The findings can help to inform sustainable\nstrategies and suggestions for the pandemic control.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin Sundström, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments.

Devitt, Kae Nemoto, Ilia Polian\nSummary: The realisation of large-scale quantum computing is no longer simply a\nhardware question. The rapid development of quantum technology has resulted in\ndozens of control and programming problems that should be directed towards the\nclassical computer science and engineering community. One such problem is known\nas Pauli tracking. Methods for implementing quantum algorithms that are\ncompatible with crucial error correction technology utilise extensive quantum\nteleportation protocols. These protocols are intrinsically probabilistic and\nresult in correction operators that occur as byproducts of teleportation. These\nbyproduct operators do not need to be corrected in the quantum hardware itself.\nInstead, byproduct operators are tracked through the circuit and output results\nreinterpreted. This tracking is routinely ignored in quantum information as it\nis assumed that tracking algorithms will eventually be developed. In this work\nwe help fill this gap and present an algorithm for tracking byproduct operators\nthrough a quantum computation. We formulate this work based on quantum gate\nsets that are compatible with all major forms of quantum error correction and\ndemonstrate the completeness of the algorithm.\n\nPublished: 2022-08-04\nTitle: NISQ: Error Correction, Mitigation, and Noise Simulation\nAuthors: Ningping Cao, Junan Lin, David Kribs, Yiu-Tung Poon, Bei Zeng, Raymond Laflamme\nSummary: Error-correcting codes were invented to correct errors on noisy communication\nchannels. Quantum error correction (QEC), however, may have a wider range of\nuses, including information transmission, quantum simulation/computation, and\nfault-tolerance. These invite us to rethink QEC, in particular, about the role\nthat quantum physics plays in terms of encoding and decoding. The fact that\nmany quantum algorithms, especially near-term hybrid quantum-classical\nalgorithms, only use limited types of local measurements on quantum states,\nleads to various new techniques called Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM). This\nwork examines the task of QEM from several perspectives. Using some intuitions\nbuilt upon classical and quantum communication scenarios, we clarify some\nfundamental distinctions between QEC and QEM. We then discuss the implications\nof noise invertibility for QEM, and give an explicit construction called\nDrazin-inverse for non-invertible noise, which is trace preserving while the\ncommonly-used Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse may not be. Finally, we study the\nconsequences of having an imperfect knowledge about the noise, and derive\nconditions when noise can be reduced using QEM.; Answer: task complete.

Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.\n\nPublished: 2022-09-10\nTitle: Enabling Under-Ice Geochemical Observations with a Size, Weight, and Power-Constrained Robot\nAuthors: Jess Horowitz, Victoria Preston, Anna P.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors.

At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1].

First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022.

This paper\nexamines whether public attention to COVID-19 in individualistic countries\nversus collectivistic countries Granger causes Bitcoin returns between February\n11, 2020 and May 09, 2022. To this end, eight large economies with a\nindividualistic or collectivistic tradition are chosen for analyses. By using\nrolling and recursive-evolving algorithms, it accounts for the timing of\nCOVID-19 issues that vary by country and circumvents the potential estimation\nbias that a traditional Granger causality test may suffer due largely to\nGoogle\'s sampling variation for different time frames. In general,\ncollectivistic countries are found to have stronger causal impacts on Bitcoin\nreturns than individualistic countries.; Answer: task complete.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin Sundström, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-12-04\nTitle: Efficient Social Distancing for COVID-19: An Integration of Economic Health and Public Health\nAuthors: Kexin Chen, Chi Seng Pun, Hoi Ying Wong\nSummary: Social distancing has been the only effective way to contain the spread of an\ninfectious disease prior to the availability of the pharmaceutical treatment.\nIt can lower the infection rate of the disease at the economic cost. A pandemic\ncrisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a\nlong-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic\ncost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to\nmanage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for\nCOVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The\nsocial distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently\naccessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community\nmobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven\neconomic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the\nsearch of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control\nproblem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach. By\napplying our framework to the US data, we empirically examine the efficiency of\nthe US social distancing policy and offer recommendations generated from the\nalgorithm.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Curasi, Erin K. Grey, Nitesh V. Chawla, David M. Lodge\nSummary: Rapid climate change has wide-ranging implications for the Arctic region,\nincluding sea ice loss, increased geopolitical attention, and expanding\neconomic activity, including a dramatic increase in shipping activity. As a\nresult, the risk of harmful non-native marine species being introduced into\nthis critical region will increase unless policy and management steps are\nimplemented in response. Using big data about shipping, ecoregions, and\nenvironmental conditions, we leverage network analysis and data mining\ntechniques to assess, visualize, and project ballast water-mediated species\nintroductions into the Arctic and dispersal of non-native species within the\nArctic. We first identify high-risk connections between the Arctic and\nnon-Arctic ports that could be sources of non-native species over 15 years\n(1997-2012) and observe the emergence of shipping hubs in the Arctic where the\ncumulative risk of non-native species introduction is increasing. We then\nconsider how environmental conditions can constrain this Arctic introduction\nnetwork for species with different physiological limits, thus providing a\nspecies-level tool for decision-makers.

Tuomi, T. Thum, H. Järvinen, S. Fronzek, B. Berg, M. Harmon, J. A. Trofymow, S. Sevanto, J. Liski\nSummary: Litter decomposition is an important process in the global carbon cycle. It\naccounts for most of the heterotrophic soil respiration and results in\nformation of more stable soil organic carbon (SOC) which is the largest\nterrestrial carbon stock. Litter decomposition may induce remarkable feedbacks\nto climate change because it is a climate-dependent process. To investigate the\nglobal patterns of litter decomposition, we developed a description of this\nprocess and tested the validity of this description using a large set of foliar\nlitter mass loss measurements (nearly 10 000 data points derived from\napproximately 70 000 litter bags). We applied the Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmethod to estimate uncertainty in the parameter values and results of our model\ncalled Yasso07. The model appeared globally applicable. It estimated the\neffects of litter type (plant species) and climate on mass loss with little\nsystematic error over the first 10 decomposition years, using only initial\nlitter chemistry, air temperature and precipitation as input variables.\nIllustrative of the global variability in litter mass loss rates, our example\ncalculations showed that a typical conifer litter had 68% of its initial mass\nstill remaining after two decomposition years in tundra while a deciduous\nlitter had only 15% remaining in the tropics. Uncertainty in these estimates, a\ndirect result of the uncertainty of the parameter values of the model, varied\naccording to the distribution of the litter bag data among climate conditions\nand ranged from 2% in tundra to 4% in the tropics. This reliability was\nadequate to use the model and distinguish the effects of even small differences\nin litter quality or climate conditions on litter decomposition as\nstatistically significant.\n\nPublished: 2010-07-09\nTitle: Study Of The Fundamental Physical Principles in Atmospheric Modeling Based On Identification Of Atmosphere - Climate Control Factors: Bromine Explosion At The Polar Arctic Sunrise\nAuthors: M.

A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics. At the same time, new challenges create new\nopportunities and research directions, e.g. renewed interest in non-constrained\niris or periocular recognition, touch-less fingerprint- and vein-based\nauthentication and the use of biometric characteristics for disease detection.\nThis article presents an overview of the research carried out to address those\nchallenges and emerging opportunities.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-07\nTitle: COVID-19: What If Immunity Wanes?\nAuthors: M. Alper Çenesiz, Luís Guimarães\nSummary: Using a simple economic model in which social-distancing reduces contagion,\nwe study the implications of waning immunity for the epidemiological dynamics\nand social activity. If immunity wanes, we find that COVID-19 likely becomes\nendemic and that social-distancing is here to stay until the discovery of a\nvaccine or cure. But waning immunity does not necessarily change optimal\nactions on the onset of the pandemic. Decentralized equilibria are virtually\nindependent of waning immunity until close to peak infections. For centralized\nequilibria, the relevance of waning immunity decreases in the probability of\nfinding a vaccine or cure, the costs of infection (e.g., infection-fatality\nrate), and the presence of other NPIs that lower contagion (e.g., quarantining\nand mask use). In simulations calibrated to July 2020, our model suggests that\nwaning immunity is virtually unimportant for centralized equilibria until at\nleast 2021. This provides vital time for individuals and policymakers to learn\nabout immunity against SARS-CoV-2 before it becomes critical.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin Sundström, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.; Answer: task complete.

In\nthis formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,\nwhile gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum\noperations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum circuit model.

They will\nlikely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,\ncomputation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally\nstochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum\ncomputation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum\nalgorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo\ntechniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum\ncomputation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to\nrevolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be\ngenerated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine\nrandom numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up\nmedian evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This\npaper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and\nquantum information.

Loke\nSummary: This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to\ndistributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet, analogous to\n(classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over\nthe (classical) Internet. Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas\nof study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum\ninformation for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable\nblind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum\napplications, over Internet-scale distances.\n\nPublished: 2013-11-20\nTitle: Geometrical perspective on quantum states and quantum computation\nAuthors: Zeqian Chen\nSummary: We interpret quantum computing as a geometric evolution process by\nreformulating finite quantum systems via Connes\' noncommutative geometry. In\nthis formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,\nwhile gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum\noperations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric\nway of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative\nproposal of building a quantum computer.\n\nPublished: 2012-10-02\nTitle: Quantum Computation and Quantum Information\nAuthors: Yazhen Wang\nSummary: Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in\ncomputer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will\nlikely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,\ncomputation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally\nstochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum\ncomputation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum\nalgorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo\ntechniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum\ncomputation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to\nrevolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be\ngenerated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine\nrandom numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up\nmedian evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This\npaper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and\nquantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and\nquantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much\nfaster than the available classic algorithms.

At the current rate, quantum computers are\ngrowing in size rapidly backed up by the increase of research in the field.\nSignificant efforts are being made to improve the reliability of quantum\nhardware and to develop suitable software to program quantum computers. In\ncontrast, the verification of quantum programs has received relatively less\nattention. Verifying programs is especially important in the quantum setting\ndue to how difficult it is to program complex algorithms correctly on\nresource-constrained and error-prone quantum hardware. Research into creating\nverification frameworks for quantum programs has seen recent development, with\na variety of tools implemented using a collection of theoretical ideas. This\nsurvey aims to be a short introduction into the area of formal verification of\nquantum programs, bringing together theory and tools developed to date.\nFurther, this survey examines some of the challenges that the field may face in\nthe future, namely the development of complex quantum algorithms.\n\nPublished: 2017-04-10\nTitle: Multiparty Delegated Quantum Computing\nAuthors: Elham Kashefi, Anna Pappa\nSummary: Quantum computing has seen tremendous progress in the past years. However,\ndue to limitations in scalability of quantum technologies, it seems that we are\nfar from constructing universal quantum computers for everyday users. A more\nfeasible solution is the delegation of computation to powerful quantum servers\non the network. This solution was proposed in previous studies of Blind Quantum\nComputation, with guarantees for both the secrecy of the input and of the\ncomputation being performed. In this work, we further develop this idea of\ncomputing over encrypted data, to propose a multiparty delegated quantum\ncomputing protocol in the measurement-based quantum computing framework.\n\nPublished: 2020-11-30\nTitle: A rigorous and robust quantum speed-up in supervised machine learning\nAuthors: Yunchao Liu, Srinivasan Arunachalam, Kristan Temme\nSummary: Over the past few years several quantum machine learning algorithms were\nproposed that promise quantum speed-ups over their classical counterparts. Most\nof these learning algorithms either assume quantum access to data -- making it\nunclear if quantum speed-ups still exist without making these strong\nassumptions, or are heuristic in nature with no provable advantage over\nclassical algorithms. In this paper, we establish a rigorous quantum speed-up\nfor supervised classification using a general-purpose quantum learning\nalgorithm that only requires classical access to data. Our quantum classifier\nis a conventional support vector machine that uses a fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputer to estimate a kernel function. Data samples are mapped to a quantum\nfeature space and the kernel entries can be estimated as the transition\namplitude of a quantum circuit. We construct a family of datasets and show that\nno classical learner can classify the data inverse-polynomially better than\nrandom guessing, assuming the widely-believed hardness of the discrete\nlogarithm problem. Meanwhile, the quantum classifier achieves high accuracy and\nis robust against additive errors in the kernel entries that arise from finite\nsampling statistics.; Answer: task complete.

However, analyzing medical images is a complex and\ntime-consuming task that requires expertise and experience. This article aims\nto design a decision support system to assist healthcare providers and patients\nin making decisions about diagnosing, treating, and managing health conditions.\nThe proposed architecture contains three stages: 1) data collection and\nlabeling, 2) model training, and 3) diagnosis report generation. The key idea\nis to train a deep learning model on a medical image dataset to extract four\ntypes of information: the type of image scan, the body part, the test image,\nand the results. This information is then fed into ChatGPT to generate\nautomatic diagnostics. The proposed system has the potential to enhance\ndecision-making, reduce costs, and improve the capabilities of healthcare\nproviders.

It involves computing similarity scores between a query medical\nimage and possible disease categories to determine the diagnostic result.\nRecent advances in pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have\nshown great performance for zero-shot natural image recognition and exhibit\nbenefits in medical applications. However, an explainable zero-shot medical\nimage recognition framework with promising performance is yet under\ndevelopment. In this paper, we propose a novel CLIP-based zero-shot medical\nimage classification framework supplemented with ChatGPT for explainable\ndiagnosis, mimicking the diagnostic process performed by human experts. The key\nidea is to query large language models (LLMs) with category names to\nautomatically generate additional cues and knowledge, such as disease symptoms\nor descriptions other than a single category name, to help provide more\naccurate and explainable diagnosis in CLIP. We further design specific prompts\nto enhance the quality of generated texts by ChatGPT that describe visual\nmedical features. Extensive results on one private dataset and four public\ndatasets along with detailed analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and\nexplainability of our training-free zero-shot diagnosis pipeline, corroborating\nthe great potential of VLMs and LLMs for medical applications.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

This leads to computation of the models, to explore their\nproperties. Quantum walks have also been shown to be universal for quantum\ncomputing. This is a more subtle result than is often appreciated, since it\napplies to computations run on qubit-based quantum computers in the single\nwalker case, and physical quantum walks in the multi-walker case (quantum\ncellular automata).

Of\nparticular interest are wetlands, a type of ecosystem that constitutes the most\neffective terrestrial long-term carbon store. As permafrost thaws, the carbon\nthat was locked in these wetland soils for millennia becomes available for\naerobic and anaerobic decomposition, which releases CO2 and CH4, respectively,\nback to the atmosphere.As CO2 and CH4 are potent greenhouse gases, this\ntransfer of carbon from the land to the atmosphere further contributes to\nglobal warming, thereby increasing the rate of permafrost degradation in a\npositive feedback loop. Therefore, monitoring Arctic wetland health and\ndynamics is a key scientific task that is also of importance for policy.\nHowever, the identification and delineation of these important wetland\necosystems, remain incomplete and often inaccurate. Mapping the extent of\nArctic wetlands remains a challenge for the scientific community. Conventional,\ncoarser remote sensing methods are inadequate at distinguishing the diverse and\nmicro-topographically complex non-vascular vegetation that characterize Arctic\nwetlands, presenting the need for better identification methods. To tackle this\nchallenging problem, we constructed and annotated the first-of-its-kind Arctic\nWetland Dataset (AWD). Based on that, we present ArcticNet, a deep neural\nnetwork that exploits the multi-spectral, high-resolution imagery captured from\nnanosatellites (Planet Dove CubeSats) with additional DEM from the ArcticDEM\nproject, to semantically label a Arctic study area into six types, in which\nthree Arctic wetland functional types are included. We present multi-fold\nefforts to handle the arising challenges, including class imbalance, and the\nchoice of fusion strategies. Preliminary results endorse the high promise of\nArcticNet, achieving 93.12% in labelling a hold-out set of regions in our\nArctic study area.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-01\nTitle: Surrogate sea ice model enables efficient tuning\nAuthors: Kelly Kochanski, Ivana Cvijanovic, Donald Lucas\nSummary: Predicting changes in sea ice cover is critical for shipping, ecosystem\nmonitoring, and climate modeling. Current sea ice models, however, predict more\nice than is observed in the Arctic, and less in the Antarctic. Improving the\nfit of these physics-based models to observations is challenging because the\nmodels are expensive to run, and therefore expensive to optimize. Here, we\nconstruct a machine learning surrogate that emulates the effect of changing\nmodel physics on forecasts of sea ice area from the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model\n(CICE). We use the surrogate model to investigate the sensitivity of CICE to\nchanges in the parameters governing: ice\'s ridging and albedo; snow\'s albedo,\naging, and thermal conductivity; the effect of meltwater on albedo; and the\neffect of ponds on albedo. We find that CICE\'s sensitivity to these model\nparameters differs between hemispheres. We propose that future sea ice modelers\nseparate the snow conductivity and snow grain size distributions on a seasonal\nand inter-hemispheric basis, and we recommend optimal values of these\nparameters. This will make it possible to make models that fit observations of\nboth Arctic and Antarctic sea ice more closely. These results demonstrate that\nimportant aspects of the behavior of a leading sea ice model can be captured by\na relatively simple support vector regression surrogate model, and that this\nsurrogate dramatically increases the ease of tuning the full simulation.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

As technology\nhas morphed into a commodity for daily tasks and actions, this article may be\nuseful for people of all ages and backgrounds who are interested in\nunderstanding the impact of technology on society.\n\nPublished: 2020-12-04\nTitle: Efficient Social Distancing for COVID-19: An Integration of Economic Health and Public Health\nAuthors: Kexin Chen, Chi Seng Pun, Hoi Ying Wong\nSummary: Social distancing has been the only effective way to contain the spread of an\ninfectious disease prior to the availability of the pharmaceutical treatment.\nIt can lower the infection rate of the disease at the economic cost. A pandemic\ncrisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a\nlong-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic\ncost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to\nmanage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for\nCOVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The\nsocial distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently\naccessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community\nmobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven\neconomic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the\nsearch of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control\nproblem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global econ; Answer: task complete.

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities.\n\nPublished: 2022-09-15\nTitle: Bitcoin Returns and Public Attention to COVID-19: Do Timing and Individualism Matter?\nAuthors: Huaxin Wang-Lu\nSummary: The evolution of the pandemic and people\'s concern over it have an impact on\nthe Bitcoin market, while the extent of individualism could differentiate\ninvestor behaviors in the financial market during the pandemic. This paper\nexamines whether public attention to COVID-19 in individualistic countries\nversus collectivistic countries Granger causes Bitcoin returns between February\n11, 2020 and May 09, 2022. To this end, eight large economies with a\nindividualistic or collectivistic tradition are chosen for analyses. By using\nrolling and recursive-evolving algorithms, it accounts for the timing of\nCOVID-19 issues that vary by country and circumvents the potential estimation\nbias that a traditional Granger causality test may suffer due largely to\nGoogle\'s sampling variation for different time frames. In general,\ncollectivistic countries are found to have stronger causal impacts on Bitcoin\nreturns than individualistic countries.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Data plays a crucial role in developing\nML-based healthcare systems that directly affect people\'s lives. Many of the\nethical issues surrounding the use of ML in healthcare stem from structural\ninequalities underlying the way we collect, use, and handle data. Developing\nguidelines to improve documentation practices regarding the creation, use, and\nmaintenance of ML healthcare datasets is therefore of critical importance. In\nthis work, we introduce Healthsheet, a contextualized adaptation of the\noriginal datasheet questionnaire ~\\cite{gebru2018datasheets} for\nhealth-specific applications. Through a series of semi-structured interviews,\nwe adapt the datasheets for healthcare data documentation. As part of the\nHealthsheet development process and to understand the obstacles researchers\nface in creating datasheets, we worked with three publicly-available healthcare\ndatasets as our case studies, each with different types of structured data:\nElectronic health Records (EHR), clinical trial study data, and\nsmartphone-based performance outcome measures. Our findings from the\ninterviewee study and case studies show 1) that datasheets should be\ncontextualized for healthcare, 2) that despite incentives to adopt\naccountability practices such as datasheets, there is a lack of consistency in\nthe broader use of these practices 3) how the ML for health community views\ndatasheets and particularly \\textit{Healthsheets} as diagnostic tool to surface\nthe limitations and strength of datasets and 4) the relative importance of\ndifferent fields in the datasheet to healthcare concerns.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-25\nTitle: The Significance of Machine Learning in Clinical Disease Diagnosis: A Review\nAuthors: S M Atikur Rahman, Sifat Ibtisum, Ehsan Bazgir, Tumpa Barai\nSummary: The global need for effective disease diagnosis remains substantial, given\nthe complexities of various disease mechanisms and diverse patient symptoms.

Smeaton\nSummary: Computer vision and multimedia information processing have made extreme\nprogress within the last decade and many tasks can be done with a level of\naccuracy as if done by humans, or better. This is because we leverage the\nbenefits of huge amounts of data available for training, we have enormous\ncomputer processing available and we have seen the evolution of machine\nlearning as a suite of techniques to process data and deliver accurate\nvision-based systems. What kind of applications do we use this processing for ?\nWe use this in autonomous vehicle navigation or in security applications,\nsearching CCTV for example, and in medical image analysis for healthcare\ndiagnostics. One application which is not widespread is image or video search\ndirectly by users. In this paper we present the need for such image finding or\nre-finding by examining human memory and when it fails, thus motivating the\nneed for a different approach to image search which is outlined, along with the\nrequirements of computer vision to support it.\n\nPublished: 2022-11-26\nTitle: A Review of Causality for Learning Algorithms in Medical Image Analysis\nAuthors: Athanasios Vlontzos, Daniel Rueckert, Bernhard Kainz\nSummary: Medical image analysis is a vibrant research area that offers doctors and\nmedical practitioners invaluable insight and the ability to accurately diagnose\nand monitor disease. Machine learning provides an additional boost for this\narea. However, machine learning for medical image analysis is particularly\nvulnerable to natural biases like domain shifts that affect algorithmic\nperformance and robustness. In this paper we analyze machine learning for\nmedical image analysis within the framework of Technology Readiness Levels and\nreview how causal analysis methods can fill a gap when creating robust and\nadaptable medical image analysis algorithms. We review methods using causality\nin medical imaging AI/ML and find that causal analysis has the potential to\nmitigate critical problems for clinical translation but that uptake and\nclinical downstream research has been limited so far.\n\nPublished: 2018-09-14\nTitle: Not-so-supervised: a survey of semi-supervised, multi-instance, and transfer learning in medical image analysis\nAuthors: Veronika Cheplygina, Marleen de Bruijne, Josien P.

The edge computing trend, along with\ntechniques for distributed machine learning such as federated learning, have\ngained popularity as a viable solution in such settings. In this paper, we\nleverage the capabilities of edge computing in medicine by analyzing and\nevaluating the potential of intelligent processing of clinical visual data at\nthe edge allowing the remote healthcare centers, lacking advanced diagnostic\nfacilities, to benefit from the multi-modal data securely. To this aim, we\nutilize the emerging concept of clustered federated learning (CFL) for an\nautomatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Such an automated system can help reduce the\nburden on healthcare systems across the world that has been under a lot of\nstress since the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late 2019.

The world is currently facing intensifying environmental\nfluctuations. Understanding general trends in ecosystem transformations in\nresponse to environmental fluctuations and elucidating the underlying\nmechanisms are thus critical challenges. In this study, we used a model\necosystem approach to investigate ecosystem alterations caused by escalating\nenvironmental fluctuations. We analyzed two distinct models: a stochastic\necosystem model with a spatial structure, and a differential equation model for\nresource competition. We found that environmental fluctuations tend to shift\nmulti-species coexistence toward the dominance of specific species. We also\ncategorized biological species as specialists or generalists and discovered\nthat which of these groups becomes the dominant species depends on the\nintensity and frequency of environmental fluctuations. We also determined that\na qualitative change in the diversity-stability relationship depends on the\nperiod of environmental fluctuations. These results underscore the need to\nexplicitly consider the type of perturbation when discussing ecological\ntransitions and the stability of ecosystems. Our findings advance understanding\nof the mechanisms underlying how environmental changes reshape ecosystems and\noffer insights into ecosystem sustainability in the face of future\nenvironmental perturbations.\n\nPublished: 2022-08-15\nTitle: Latent trajectory models for spatio-temporal dynamics in Alaskan ecosystems\nAuthors: Xinyi Lu, Mevin B.

Stehn\nSummary: The Alaskan landscape has undergone substantial changes in recent decades,\nmost notably the expansion of shrubs and trees across the Arctic. We developed\na dynamic statistical model to quantify the impact of climate change on the\nstructural transformation of ecosystems using remotely sensed imagery. We used\nlatent trajectory processes in a hierarchical framework to model dynamic state\nprobabilities that evolve annually, from which we derived transition\nprobabilities between ecotypes. Our latent trajectory model accommodates\ntemporal irregularity in survey intervals and uses spatio-temporally\nheterogeneous climate drivers to infer rates of land cover transitions. We\ncharacterized multi-scale spatial correlation induced by plot and subplot\narrangement in our study system. We also developed a Polya-Gamma sampling\nstrategy to improve computation. Our model facilitates inference on the\nresponse of ecosystems to shifts in the climate and can be used to predict\nfuture land cover transitions under various climate scenarios.\n\nPublished: 2013-08-22\nTitle: Fluctuations and seasonality in the Arctic sea ice area: A sudden regime shift in 2007?\nAuthors: Peter D. Ditlevsen, Ivana Cvijanovic\nSummary: Since the beginning of satellite observations, the Arctic sea ice extent has\nshown a downward trend. The decline has been weaker in the March maximum than\nin the September minimum and masked by inter-annual fluctuations. One of the\nless understood aspects of the sea ice response is the persistence times for\nfluctuations, which could indicate the dominant physical processes behind the\nsea ice decline. To determine the fluctuation persistence times, however, it is\nnecessary to first filter out the dominant effect of the seasonal cycle. In the\ncurrent study, we thus develop a statistical model, which accurately decomposes\nthe ice area changes into: (1) a variable seasonal cycle component with a\nconstant shape and (2) a residual (short term) fluctuation.\n  We find the persistence time of fluctuations to be only about three weeks,\nindependently from season, which is substantially shorter than previously\nrepor; Answer: task complete.

In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-07\nTitle: Global Surface Warming Caused by Shorter-term Radiative Forcings of Aerosols and Ozone in the Last Two Decades\nAuthors: Qing-Bin Lu\nSummary: Conventional climate models have predicted continuous warming on the Earth\'s\nsurface and cooling in the upper stratosphere. Here we report observations of\nregional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface\ntemperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs),\nozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent\n(SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by\na conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6)\nand 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and\nAntarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since\n2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide\nfingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar\n(non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both\nsurface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016\nonce the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes,\nwhich caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by\nthe positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to\nimproved air quality. The observed GMST changes agree well with calculated\nresults by the physics model based on halogen-containing GHGs, whose\nd; Answer: task complete.

Breuckmann, Jens Niklas Eberhardt\nSummary: Quantum error correction is an indispensable ingredient for scalable quantum\ncomputing. In this Perspective we discuss a particular class of quantum codes\ncalled low-density parity-check (LDPC) quantum codes. The codes we discuss are\nalternatives to the surface code, which is the currently leading candidate to\nimplement quantum fault-tolerance. We introduce the zoo of LDPC quantum codes\nand discuss their potential for making quantum computers robust against noise.\nIn particular, we explain recent advances in the theory of LDPC quantum codes\nrelated to certain product constructions and discuss open problems in the\nfield.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-06\nTitle: Error correcting power of small topological codes\nAuthors: Naomi H. Nickerson\nSummary: Many quantum technologies are now reaching a high level of maturity and\ncontrol, and it is likely that the first demonstrations of suppression of\nnaturally occurring quantum noise using small topological error correcting\ncodes will soon be possible. In doing this it will be necessary to define clear\nachievable metrics to measure and compare the performance of real codes. Here\nwe consider the smallest examples of several families of topological codes:\nsurface codes, color codes, and the gauge color code, and determine the minimum\nrequirements to demonstrate error suppression. We use an exact decoder to\ncompare the performance of the codes under simple models of both physical error\nand measurement error, and determine regions of correctability in the physical\nparameters for each code.\n\nPublished: 2024-04-24\nTitle: Lattice Surgery for Dummies\nAuthors: Avimita Chatterjee, Subrata Das, Swaroop Ghosh\nSummary: Quantum error correction (QEC) plays a crucial role in correcting noise and\npaving the way for fault-tolerant quantum computing. This field has seen\nsignificant advancements, with new quantum error correction codes emerging\nregularly to address errors effectively. Among these, topological codes,\nparticularly surface codes, stand out for their low error thresholds and\nfeasibility for implementation in large-scale quantum computers. However, these\ncodes are restricted to encoding a single qubit. Lattice surgery is crucial for\nenabling interactions among multiple encoded qubits or between the lattices of\na surface code, ensuring that its sophisticated error-correcting features are\nmaintained without significantly increasing the operational overhead. Lattice\nsurgery is pivotal for scaling QECCs across more extensive quantum systems.\nDespite its critical importance, comprehending lattice surgery is challenging\ndue to its inherent complexity, demanding a deep understanding of intricate\nquantum physics and mathematical concepts. This paper endeavors to demystify\nlattice surgery, making it accessible to those without a profound background in\nquantum physics or mathematics. This work explores surface codes, introduces\nthe basics of lattice surgery, and demonstrates its application in building\nquantum gates and emulating multi-qubit circuits.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

Mechanistic viral dynamics and quantitative systems\npharmacology models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccines, immunomodulatory agents,\nand antiviral therapeutics have played a key role in advancing our\nunderstanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and transmission, the interplay\nbetween innate and adaptive immunity to influence the outcomes of infection,\neffectiveness of treatments, mechanisms and performance of COVID-19 vaccines,\nand the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

These uncertainties stem from the disease\nprogression, government interventions, economy and consumer behavior. While\nmost of the emerging literature on the pandemic has focused on disease\nprogression, a few have focused on consequent regulations and their impact on\nindividual behavior. The contributions of this paper include a quantitative\nbehavior model of fear of COVID-19, impact of government interventions on\nconsumer behavior, and impact of consumer behavior on consumer choice and hence\ndemand for goods. It brings together multiple models for disease progression,\nconsumer behavior and demand estimation-thus bridging the gap between disease\nprogression and consumer demand. We use panel regression to understand the\ndrivers of demand during the pandemic and Bayesian inference to simplify the\nregulation landscape that can help build scenarios for resilient demand\nplanning.

Nielsen, David Poulin\nSummary: Operator quantum error-correction is a technique for robustly storing quantum\ninformation in the presence of noise. It generalizes the standard theory of\nquantum error-correction, and provides a unified framework for topics such as\nquantum error-correction, decoherence-free subspaces, and noiseless subsystems.\nThis paper develops (a) easily applied algebraic and information-theoretic\nconditions which characterize when operator quantum error-correction is\nfeasible; (b) a representation theorem for a class of noise processes which can\nbe corrected using operator quantum error-correction; and (c) generalizations\nof the coherent information and quantum data processing inequality to the\nsetting of operator quantum error-correction.\n\nPublished: 2018-06-10\nTitle: Learning time-dependent noise to reduce logical errors: Real time error rate estimation in quantum error correction\nAuthors: Ming-Xia Huo, Ying Li\nSummary: Quantum error correction is important to quantum information processing,\nwhich allows us to reliably process information encoded in quantum error\ncorrection codes. Efficient quantum error correction benefits from the\nknowledge of error rates. We propose a protocol for monitoring error rates in\nreal time without interrupting the quantum error correction. Any adaptation of\nthe quantum error correction code or its implementation circuit is not\nrequired. The protocol can be directly applied to the most advanced quantum\nerror correction techniques, e.g. surface code. A Gaussian processes algorithm\nis used to estimate and predict error rates based on error correction data in\nthe past. We find that using these estimated error rates, the probability of\nerror correction failures can be significantly reduced by a factor increasing\nwith the code distance.\n\nPublished: 2006-02-18\nTitle: An Introduction to Error-Correcting Codes: From Classical to Quantum\nAuthors: Hsun-Hsien Chang\nSummary: This report surveys quantum error-correcting codes. As Preskill claimed, 21st\ncentury would be the golden age of quantum error correction. Quantum channels\nbehave differently from classical channels, so researchers face difficulties in\ndeveloping robust quantum codes. Fortunately, the classical error control\nmethods have been well developed. If we can learn many lessons from classical\ncoding theory, we can expedite the development of quantum codes. Scientists\nhave discovered that quantum error correction shares many concepts with\nclassical counterpart. Both quantum and classical coding schemes add redundancy\nto information to protect against noises. They also have similar conditions for\nerror detectability and correctability.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).

However, combining these measures into an efficient holistic\npandemic response instrument is even more involved than anticipated. We argue\nthat some non-trivial factors behind the varying effectiveness of these\nmeasures are selfish decision making and the differing national implementations\nof the response mechanism. In this paper, through simple games, we show the\neffect of individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to mask\nwearing, social distancing and vaccination, and how these may result in\nsub-optimal outcomes. We also demonstrate the responsibility of national\nauthorities in designing these games properly regarding data transparency, the\nchosen policies and their influence on the preferred outcome. We promote a\nmechanism design approach: it is in the best interest of every government to\ncarefully balance social good and response costs when implementing their\nrespective pandemic response mechanism; moreover, there is no one-size-fits-all\nsolution when designing an effective solution.\n\nPublished: 2020-12-04\nTitle: Efficient Social Distancing for COVID-19: An Integration of Economic Health and Public Health\nAuthors: Kexin Chen, Chi Seng Pun, Hoi Ying Wong\nSummary: Social distancing has been the only effective way to contain the spread of an\ninfectious disease prior to the availability of the pharmaceutical treatment.\nIt can lower the infection rate of the disease at the economic cost. A pandemic\ncrisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a\nlong-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic\ncost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to\nmanage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for\nCOVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The\nsocial distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently\naccessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community\nmobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven\neconomic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the\nsearch of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control\nproblem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach.

We find that new infections\nand deaths are both significantly negatively associated with the fraction of\nthe population vaccinated with at least one dose. Conditional on first-dose\ncoverage, an increased fraction with two doses appears to offer no further\nreductions in new cases and deaths. For vaccines from China, however, we find\nsignificant effects on both health outcomes only after two doses.

Yet, such control measures commonly have a negative effect on the\neconomy. Here, we propose a macro-level approach to support resolving this\nHealth-Economy Dilemma (HED). First, an extension to the well-known SEIR model\nis suggested which includes an economy model.

Next, several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are\napplied to perform a study on the health-economy performance trade-offs that\nare inherent to the obtained optimal policies. Finally, the results from the\napplied algorithms are compared to select a preferred algorithm for future\nstudies. As expected, for the proposed models and strategies, a clear conflict\nbetween the health and economy performances is found.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

Countries irrespective of economic\nstatus have succumbed to this pandemic. Many aspects of the lives, including\nhealth, economy, freedom of movement have been negatively affected by the\ncoronavirus outbreak. Numerous strategies have been taken in order to prevent\nthe outbreak. Some countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale\nlockdown, while others took a moderate approach of dealing with the pandemics,\nfor example, mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings,\nrestricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown\nstrategies due to inadequate economy and health care support.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, Théo Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of the\nemissions-neutrality constraint in the absence of a carbon price is to reduce\nthe quantity of storage purchased and reduce annual system emissions (~3%),\nwith only minor increases in overall cost (~0.1%). In cases with a carbon\nprice, storage does not tend to increase emissions and the emissions constraint\ndoes not tend to decrease storage investment. The emissions-neutrality\nconstraint is seen to deliver similar emissions reductions even in a system\nwith much higher renewable penetration (46%).\n\nPublished: 2024-02-04\nTitle: On the Stability of Strategic Energy Storage Operation in Wholesale Electricity Markets (Extended Version)\nAuthors: Aviad Navon, Juri Belikov, Ariel Orda, Yoash Levron\nSummary: High shares of variable renewable energy necessitate substantial energy\nstorage capacity. However, it remains unclear how to design a market that, on\nthe one hand, ensures a stable and sufficient income for storage firms, and, on\nthe other hand, maintains stable and affordable electricity costs for the\nconsumers. Here, we use a game theoretic model to study storage competition in\nwholesale electricity markets. A main result is that these types of games are\nnot necessarily stable. In particular, we find that under certain conditions,\nwhich imply a combination of a high share of variable renewable energy sources\nand low flexibility of conventional power plants, the system will not converge\nto an equilibrium. However, we demonstrate that a price cap on storage price\nbids can ensure convergence to a stable solution. Moreover, we find that when\nthe flexibility of conventional power plants is low, while the storage usage\nfor energy balancing increases with renewable energy generation, the\nprofitability of using storage for the sole purpose of energy arbitrage\ndecreases.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-04\nTitle: Optimal Sizing of On-site Renewable Resources for Offshore Microgrids\nAuthors: Ann Mary Toms, Xingpeng Li, Kaushik Rajashekara\nSummary: The offshore oil and natural gas platforms, mostly powered by diesel or gas\ngenerators, consume approximately 16TWh of electricity worldwide per year,\nwhich emits large amount of CO2. To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices.

In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

A pandemic\ncrisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a\nlong-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic\ncost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to\nmanage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for\nCOVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The\nsocial distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently\naccessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community\nmobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven\neconomic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the\nsearch of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control\nproblem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach. By\napplying our framework to the US data, we empirically examine the efficiency of\nthe US social distancing policy and offer recommendations generated from the\nalgorithm.; Answer: task complete.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities.\n\nPublished: 2022-09-15\nTitle: Bitcoin Returns and Public Attention to COVID-19: Do Timing and Individualism Matter?\nAuthors: Huaxin Wang-Lu\nSummary: The evolution of the pandemic and people\'s concern over it have an impact on\nthe Bitcoin market, while the extent of individualism could differentiate\ninvestor behaviors in the financial market during the pandemic. This paper\nexamines whether public attention to COVID-19 in individualistic countries\nversus collectivistic countries Granger causes Bitcoin returns between February\n11, 2020 and May 09, 2022. To this end, eight large economies with a\nindividualistic or collectivistic tradition are chosen for analyses. By using\nrolling and recursive-evolving algorithms, it accounts for the timing of\nCOVID-19 issues that vary by country and circumvents the potential estimation\nbias that a traditional Granger causality test may suffer due largely to\nGoogle\'s sampling variation for different time frames. In general,\ncollectivistic countries are found to have stronger causal impacts on Bitcoin\nreturns than individualistic countries.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin Sundström, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). In this paper a new\nmetric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for\nthe energy storage. The recent definitions in LCOE for renewable energy system\nhas been reviewed. From fundamental principles, it is demonstrated that there\nis a need to introduce a new method to evaluate LCOE of the system as the\nconventional LCOE is not applicable for renewable energy storage systems. Three\nyears of solar irradiance data in Africa collected from Johannesburg and the\nnational load data from Kenya are obtained for case studies. The proposed cost\ncalculation methods are evaluated for two types of storage technologies\n(Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Lithium-ion) with real-life data. It shows\nthat the marginal LCOE and LCOD indices can be used to assist policymakers to\nconsider the discount rate and the type of storage technology for a cost\neffective renewable storage energy system.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H.

The integration of automated systems in oral\nhealthcare has become increasingly crucial. Machine learning approaches offer a\nviable solution to address challenges such as diagnostic difficulties,\ninefficiencies, and errors in oral disease diagnosis. These methods prove\nparticularly useful when physicians struggle to predict or diagnose diseases at\ntheir early stages. In this study, thirteen different machine learning, deep\nlearning, and large language models were employed to determine the severity\nlevel of oral health issues based on radiologists\' reports. The results\nrevealed that the Few-shot learning with SBERT and Multi-Layer Perceptron model\noutperformed all other models across various experiments, achieving an\nimpressive accuracy of 94.1% as the best result. Consequently, this model\nexhibits promise as a reliable tool for evaluating the severity of oral\ndiseases, enabling patients to receive more effective treatment and aiding\nhealthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding resource\nallocation and the management of high-risk patients.\n\nPublished: 2019-10-22\nTitle: Digital Twin approach to Clinical DSS with Explainable AI\nAuthors: Dattaraj Jagdish Rao, Shraddha Mane\nSummary: We propose a digital twin approach to improve healthcare decision support\nsystems with a combination of domain knowledge and data. Domain knowledge helps\nbuild decision thresholds that doctors can use to determine a risk or recommend\na treatment or test based on the specific patient condition. However, these\nassessments tend to be highly subjective and differ from doctor to doctor and\nfrom patient to patient. We propose a system where we collate this subjective\nrisk by compiling data from different doctors treating different patients and\nbuild a machine learning model that learns from this knowledge. Then using\nstate-of-the-art explainability concepts we derive explanations from this\nmodel. These explanations give us a summary of different doctor domain\nknowledge applied in different cases to give a more generic perspective. Also\nthese explanations are specific to a particular patient and are customized for\ntheir condition.

Maimon, Neomi Hezi, Talya Zeimer, Nathan Intrator, Tanya Gurevich\nSummary: Parkinsons disease (PD) diagnosis is challenging due to subtle early clinical\nsigns. F-DOPA PET is commonly used for early PD diagnosis. We explore the\npotential of machine-learning (ML) based EEG features extracted from\nsingle-channel EEG during auditory cognitive assessment as a noninvasive,\nlow-cost support for PD diagnosis. The study included data collected from 32\nparticipants who underwent an F-DOPA PET scan as part of their standard\ntreatment and 20 cognitively healthy controls. Participants performed an\nauditory cognitive assessment recorded with Neurosteer EEG device. Data\nprocessing involved wavelet-packet decomposition and ML. First, a prediction\nmodel was developed to predict 1/3 of the undisclosed F-DOPA results. Then,\ngeneralized linear mixed models were calculated to distinguish between PD and\nnon-PD subjects on the frequency bands and ML-based EEG features (A0 and L1)\npreviously associated with cognitive functions.

Of\nparticular interest are wetlands, a type of ecosystem that constitutes the most\neffective terrestrial long-term carbon store. As permafrost thaws, the carbon\nthat was locked in these wetland soils for millennia becomes available for\naerobic and anaerobic decomposition, which releases CO2 and CH4, respectively,\nback to the atmosphere.As CO2 and CH4 are potent greenhouse gases, this\ntransfer of carbon from the land to the atmosphere further contributes to\nglobal warming, thereby increasing the rate of permafrost degradation in a\npositive feedback loop. Therefore, monitoring Arctic wetland health and\ndynamics is a key scientific task that is also of importance for policy.\nHowever, the identification and delineation of these important wetland\necosystems, remain incomplete and often inaccurate. Mapping the extent of\nArctic wetlands remains a challenge for the scientific community. Conventional,\ncoarser remote sensing methods are inadequate at distinguishing the diverse and\nmicro-topographically complex non-vascular vegetation that characterize Arctic\nwetlands, presenting the need for better identification methods. To tackle this\nchallenging problem, we constructed and annotated the first-of-its-kind Arctic\nWetland Dataset (AWD). Based on that, we present ArcticNet, a deep neural\nnetwork that exploits the multi-spectral, high-resolution imagery captured from\nnanosatellites (Planet Dove CubeSats) with additional DEM from the ArcticDEM\nproject, to semantically label a Arctic study area into six types, in which\nthree Arctic wetland functional types are included. We present multi-fold\nefforts to handle the arising challenges, including class imbalance, and the\nchoice of fusion strategies. Preliminary results endorse the high promise of\nArcticNet, achieving 93.12% in labelling a hold-out set.'}

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2023-11-20\nTitle: Exploring the Relationship Between COVID-19 Induced Economic Downturn and Women\'s Nutritional Health Disparities\nAuthors: Alaa M. Sadeq\nSummary: This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic\'s economic impact has\nexacerbated nutritional health disparities among women. It sought to understand\nthe effects of economic challenges on women\'s dietary choices and access to\nnutritious food across different socioeconomic groups. Using a mixed-methods\napproach, the research combined quantitative data from health and economic\nrecords with qualitative insights from interviews with diverse women. The study\nanalyzed trends in nutritional health and economic factors before and after the\npandemic and gathered personal accounts regarding nutrition and economic\ndifficulties during this period. Findings showed a clear link between the\neconomic downturn and deteriorating nutritional health, particularly in\nlow-income and marginalized groups. These women reported decreased access to\nhealthy foods and an increased dependence on less nutritious options due to\nbudget constraints, leading to a decline in dietary quality. This trend was\nless evident in higher-income groups, highlighting stark disparities. The\npandemic intensified pre-existing nutritional inequalities, with the most\nvulnerable groups facing greater adverse effects. However, community support\nand public health measures provided some relief. In summary, the pandemic\'s\neconomic repercussions have indirectly impaired women\'s nutritional health,\nespecially among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. This highlights the\nnecessity for tailored nutritional interventions and economic policies focused\non safeguarding women\'s health.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility.

McKinney, Mihaela van der Schaar\nSummary: Diagnostic and prognostic models are increasingly important in medicine and\ninform many clinical decisions. Recently, machine learning approaches have\nshown improvement over conventional modeling techniques by better capturing\ncomplex interactions between patient covariates in a data-driven manner.\nHowever, the use of machine learning introduces a number of technical and\npractical challenges that have thus far restricted widespread adoption of such\ntechniques in clinical settings. To address these challenges and empower\nhealthcare professionals, we present a machine learning framework,\nAutoPrognosis 2.0, to develop diagnostic and prognostic models. AutoPrognosis\nleverages state-of-the-art advances in automated machine learning to develop\noptimized machine learning pipelines, incorporates model explainability tools,\nand enables deployment of clinical demonstrators, without requiring significant\ntechnical expertise. Our framework eliminates the major technical obstacles to\npredictive modeling with machine learning that currently impede clinical\nadoption. To demonstrate AutoPrognosis 2.0, we provide an illustrative\napplication where we construct a prognostic risk score for diabetes using the\nUK Biobank, a prospective study of 502,467 individuals. The models produced by\nour automated framework achieve greater discrimination for diabetes than expert\nclinical risk scores. Our risk score has been implemented as a web-based\ndecision support tool and can be publicly accessed by patients and clinicians\nworldwide. In addition, AutoPrognosis 2.0 is provided as an open-source python\npackage. By open-sourcing our framework as a tool for the community, clinicians\nand other medical practitioners will be able to readily develop new risk\nscores, personalized diagnostics, and prognostics using modern machine learning\ntechniques.\n\nPublished: 2022-02-26\nTitle: Healthsheet: Development of a Transparency Artifact for Health Datasets\nAuthors: Negar Rostamzadeh, Diana Mincu, Subhrajit Roy, Andrew Smart, Lauren Wilcox, Mahima Pushkarna, Jessica Schrouff, Razvan Amironesei, Nyalleng Moorosi, Katherine Heller\nSummary: Machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated promising results in a\nwide range of healthcare applications. Data plays a crucial role in developing\nML-based healthcare systems that directly affect people\'s lives. Many of the\nethical issues surrounding the use of ML in healthcare stem from structural\ninequalities underlying the way we collect, use, and handle data. Developing\nguidelines to improve documentation practices regarding the creation, use, and\nmaintenance of ML healthcare datasets is therefore of critical importance. In\nthis work, we introduce Healthsheet, a contextualized adaptation of the\noriginal datasheet questionnaire ~\\cite{gebru2018datasheets} for\nhealth-specific applications. Through a series of semi-structured interviews,\nwe adapt the datasheets for healthcare data documentation. As part of the\nHealthsheet development process and to understand the obstacles researchers\nface in creating datasheets, we worked with three publicly-available healthcare\ndatasets as our case studies, each with different types of structured data:\nElectronic health Records (EHR), clinical trial study data, and\nsmartphone-based performance outcome measures. Our findings from the\ninterviewee study and case studies show 1) that datasheets should be\ncontextualized for healthcare, 2) that despite incentives to adopt\naccountability practices such as datasheets, there is a lack of consistency in\nthe broader use of these practices 3) how the ML for health community views\ndatasheets and particularly \\textit{Healthsheets} as diagnostic tool to surface\nthe limitations and strength of datasets and 4) the relative importance of\nd; Answer: task complete.

In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-07\nTitle: Global Surface Warming Caused by Shorter-term Radiative Forcings of Aerosols and Ozone in the Last Two Decades\nAuthors: Qing-Bin Lu\nSummary: Conventional climate models have predicted continuous warming on the Earth\'s\nsurface and cooling in the upper stratosphere. Here we report observations of\nregional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface\ntemperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs),\nozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent\n(SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by\na conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6)\nand 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and\nAntarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since\n2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide\nfingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar\n(non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both\nsurface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016\nonce the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes,\nwhich caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by\nthe positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to\nimproved air quality. The observed GMST changes agree well with calculated\nresults by the physics model based on halogen-containing GHGs, whose\nd; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

With global interest in the\nArctic on the rise, it becomes increasingly relevant to ensure that investments\nin arctic infrastructure actually serve the people of the Arctic, while\npromoting industrial and commercial innovation in the region through widespread\naccess to broadband and Internet of Things (IoT) services. This calls for\ninterdisciplinary research strategies that are able to connect and integrate\ntechnological and societal approaches, which are commonly applied separately\nand in isolation from one another. In this article, we propose an\ninterdisciplinary collaborative research agenda for Arctic connectivity.\nDrawing on examples from Greenland, we stress the need for localized knowledge\nto design valuable and cost-effective connectivity solutions that cover the\nneeds for everyday life and may also provide a new set of collaborative\nconnectivity tools for innovation at an international level. Such solutions,\ntermed \'frugal connectivity\', are vital for the development of connected Arctic\ncommunities.\n\nPublished: 2020-09-27\nTitle: Network analysis of ballast-mediated species transfer reveals important introduction and dispersal patterns in the Arctic\nAuthors: Mandana Saebi, Jian Xu, Salvatore R. Curasi, Erin K. Grey, Nitesh V. Chawla, David M. Lodge\nSummary: Rapid climate change has wide-ranging implications for the Arctic region,\nincluding sea ice loss, increased geopolitical attention, and expanding\neconomic activity, including a dramatic increase in shipping activity. As a\nresult, the risk of harmful non-native marine species being introduced into\nthis critical region will increase unless policy and management steps are\nimplemented in response. Using big data about shipping, ecoregions, and\nenvironmental conditions, we leverage network analysis and data mining\ntechniques to assess, visualize, and project ballast water-mediated species\nintroductions into the Arctic and dispersal of non-native species within the\nArctic.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Nickerson\nSummary: Many quantum technologies are now reaching a high level of maturity and\ncontrol, and it is likely that the first demonstrations of suppression of\nnaturally occurring quantum noise using small topological error correcting\ncodes will soon be possible. In doing this it will be necessary to define clear\nachievable metrics to measure and compare the performance of real codes. Here\nwe consider the smallest examples of several families of topological codes:\nsurface codes, color codes, and the gauge color code, and determine the minimum\nrequirements to demonstrate error suppression. We use an exact decoder to\ncompare the performance of the codes under simple models of both physical error\nand measurement error, and determine regions of correctability in the physical\nparameters for each code.\n\nPublished: 2017-08-09\nTitle: Asymmetric Quantum Codes on Toric Surfaces\nAuthors: Johan P.

Moussa\nSummary: Surface and color codes are two forms of topological quantum error correction\nin two spatial dimensions with complementary properties. Surface codes have\nlower-depth error detection circuits and well-developed decoders to interpret\nand correct errors, while color codes have transversal Clifford gates and\nbetter code efficiency in the number of physical qubits needed to achieve a\ngiven code distance. A formal equivalence exists between color codes and folded\nsurface codes, but it does not guarantee the transferability of any of these\nfavorable properties. However, the equivalence does imply the existence of\nconstant-depth circuit implementations of logical Clifford gates on folded\nsurface codes. We achieve and improve this result by constructing two families\nof folded surface codes with transversal Clifford gates. This construction is\npresented generally for qudits of any dimension. The specific application of\nthese codes to universal quantum computation based on qubit fusion is also\ndiscussed.; Answer: task complete.

Nevertheless,\nthe enormous energy consumption of BSs and the incurred huge energy cost have\nbecome significant concerns for the mobile operators. As the continuous decline\nof the renewable energy cost, equipping the power-hungry BSs with renewable\nenergy generators could be a sustainable solution. In this work, we propose an\nenergy storage aided reconfigurable renewable energy supply solution for the\nBS, which could supply clean energy to the BS and store surplus energy for\nbackup usage. Specifically, to flexibly reconfigure the battery\'s\ndischarging/charging operations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based\nreconfiguring policy, which can adapt to the dynamical renewable energy\ngenerations as well as the varying power demands. Our experiments using the\nreal-world data on renewable energy generations and power demands demonstrate\nthat, our reconfigurable power supply solution can achieve an energy saving\nratio of 74.8%, compared to the case with traditional power grid supply.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-04\nTitle: Optimal Sizing of On-site Renewable Resources for Offshore Microgrids\nAuthors: Ann Mary Toms, Xingpeng Li, Kaushik Rajashekara\nSummary: The offshore oil and natural gas platforms, mostly powered by diesel or gas\ngenerators, consume approximately 16TWh of electricity worldwide per year,\nwhich emits large amount of CO2. To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-18\nTitle: Quantum batteries -- The future of energy storage?\nAuthors: James Q. Quach, Giulio Cerullo, Tersilla Virgili\nSummary: According to the International Energy Agency, each human uses more than 80 GJ\nof energy per year; this is equivalent to leaving a washing machine\ncontinuously running for one year for every person on Earth. This consumption\nis expected to increase by 28% by 2040 (from 2015 levels). The majority (86%)\nof this energy comes from fossil fuels. This dependence on fossil fuels comes\nwith major environmental costs, with climate change arguably being the greatest\nchallenge facing our era. Renewable energy offers a possible solution. However,\nrenewable energy sources, like solar and wind are not continuous sources, and\ntherefore energy storage technology or batteries, remain an urgent challenge\nfor further worldwide adoption of renewable energy. Alongside the need for\nefficient batteries to store renewable energy, the portability of batteries\nmakes them an essential component in mobile technologies, including electric\nvehicles.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin Sundström, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be d; Answer: task complete.

Sun, Oliver J. Bear Don\'t Walk IV, Jennifer L. Chen, Harry Reyes Nieva, Noémie Elhadad\nSummary: Sex and gender-based healthcare disparities contribute to differences in\nhealth outcomes. We focus on time to diagnosis (TTD) by conducting two\nlarge-scale, complementary analyses among men and women across 29 phenotypes\nand 195K patients. We first find that women are consistently more likely to\nexperience a longer TTD than men, even when presenting with the same\nconditions. We further explore how TTD disparities affect diagnostic\nperformance between genders, both across and persistent to time, by evaluating\ngender-agnostic disease classifiers across increasing diagnostic information.\nIn both fairness analyses, the diagnostic process favors men over women,\ncontradicting the previous observation that women may demonstrate relevant\nsymptoms earlier than men. These analyses suggest that TTD is an important yet\ncomplex aspect when studying gender disparities, and warrants further\ninvestigation.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C.

A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.; Answer: task complete.

For example, how to improve battery space\nutilization, maximize battery energy storage, and how to increase and control\nthe charging power of quantum batteries. A major challenge is how to achieve\nbetter charging power without reducing the energy storage of the quantum\nbatteries. Here, we propose a controllable dual-cavity quantum battery which\ncan increase the charging power without diminishing capacity of the quantum\nbatteries by manipulating the number of atoms . This control method can\neffectively adjust the charging power of quantum batteries from $N^2$ times to\n$N^2.5$ times, and even to $N^3$ times. By adjusting the number of atoms,\nquantum batteries can achieve theoretical "fast charging" and "slow charging".; Answer: task complete.

Interactions among species form a network whose\nevolution is determined by the dynamics of the model. Numerical simulations\nshow power-law distribution of intervals between extinctions, but only for\necosystems with sufficient variability of species and with networks of\nconnectivity above certain threshold that is very close to the percolation\nthreshold of the network. Effect of slow environmental changes on extinction\ndynamics, degree distribution of the network of interspecies interactions, and\nsome emergent properties of our model are also examined.\n\nPublished: 2004-03-12\nTitle: Noise in ecosystems: a short review\nAuthors: B. Spagnolo, D. Valenti, A. Fiasconaro\nSummary: Noise, through its interaction with the nonlinearity of the living systems,\ncan give rise to counter-intuitive phenomena such as stochastic resonance,\nnoise-delayed extinction, temporal oscillations, and spatial patterns. In this\npaper we briefly review the noise-induced effects in three different\necosystems: (i) two competing species; (ii) three interacting species, one\npredator and two preys, and (iii) N-interacting species. The transient dynamics\nof these ecosystems are analyzed through generalized Lotka-Volterra equations\nin the presence of multiplicative noise, which models the interaction between\nthe species and the environment. The interaction parameter between the species\nis random in cases (i) and (iii), and a periodical function, which accounts for\nthe environmental temperature, in case (ii). We find noise-induced phenomena\nsuch as quasi-deterministic oscillations, stochastic resonance, noise-delayed\nextinction, and noise-induced pattern formation with nonmonotonic behaviors of\npatterns areas and of the density correlation as a function of the\nmultiplicative noise intensity. The asymptotic behavior of the time average of\nthe \\emph{$i^{th}$} population when the ecosystem is composed of a great number\nof interacting species is obtained and the effect of the noise on the\nasymptotic probability distributions of the populations is discussed.\n\nPublished: 2012-03-19\nTitle: On Species Persistence-Time Distributions\nAuthors: S. Suweis, E. Bertuzzo, L. Mari, I. Rodriguez-Iturbe, A. Maritan, A. Rinaldo\nSummary: We present new theoretical and empirical results on the probability\ndistributions of species persistence times in natural ecosystems. Persistence\ntimes, defined as the timespans occurring between species\' colonization and\nlocal extinction in a given geographic region, are empirically estimated from\nlocal observations of species\' presence/absence. A connected sampling problem\nis presented, generalized and solved analytically. Species persistence is shown\nto provide a direct connection with key spatial macroecological patterns like\nspecies-area and endemics-area relationships. Our empirical analysis pertains\nto two different ecosystems and taxa: a herbaceous plant community and a\nestuarine fish database. Despite the substantial differences in ecological\ninteractions and spatial scales, we confirm earlier evidence on the general\nproperties of the scaling of persistence times, including the predicted effects\nof the structure of the spatial interaction network. The framework tested here\nallows to investigate directly nature and extent of spatial effects in the\ncontext of ecosystem dynamics. The notable coherence between spatial and\ntemporal macroecological patterns, theoretically derived and empirically\nverified, is suggested to underlie general features of the dynamic evolution of\necosystems.; Answer: task complete.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin Sundström, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-05-10\nTitle: Two Burning Questions on COVID-19: Did shutting down the economy help?

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

The lack of such publicly available datasets\nis the biggest bottleneck for the development of clinical Natural Language\nProcessing(NLP) systems. Zero-Shot Learning(ZSL) refers to the use of deep\nlearning models to classify instances from new classes of which no training\ndata have been seen before. Prompt-based learning is an emerging ZSL technique\nwhere we define task-based templates for NLP tasks. We developed a novel\nprompt-based clinical NLP framework called HealthPrompt and applied the\nparadigm of prompt-based learning on clinical texts. In this technique, rather\nthan fine-tuning a Pre-trained Language Model(PLM), the task definitions are\ntuned by defining a prompt template. We performed an in-depth analysis of\nHealthPrompt on six different PLMs in a no-data setting. Our experiments prove\nthat prompts effectively capture the context of clinical texts and perform\nremarkably well without any training data.\n\nPublished: 2023-01-27\nTitle: A Multi-View Joint Learning Framework for Embedding Clinical Codes and Text Using Graph Neural Networks\nAuthors: Lecheng Kong, Christopher King, Bradley Fritz, Yixin Chen\nSummary: Learning to represent free text is a core task in many clinical machine\nlearning (ML) applications, as clinical text contains observations and plans\nnot otherwise available for inference. State-of-the-art methods use large\nlanguage models developed with immense computational resources and training\ndata; however, applying these models is challenging because of the highly\nvarying syntax and vocabulary in clinical free text. Structured information\nsuch as International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes often succinctly\nabstracts the most important facts of a clinical encounter and yields good\nperformance, but is often not as available as clinical text in real-world\nscenarios. We propose a \\textbf{multi-view learning framework} that jointly\nlearns from codes and text to combine the availability and forward-looking\nnature of text and better performance of ICD codes. The learned text embeddings\ncan be used as inputs to predictive algorithms independent of the ICD codes\nduring inference. Our approach uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to process ICD\ncodes, and Bi-LSTM to process text. We apply Deep Canonical Correlation\nAnalysis (DCCA) to enforce the two views to learn a similar representation of\neach patient. In experiments using planned surgical procedure text, our model\noutperforms BERT models fine-tuned to clinical data, and in experiments using\ndiverse text in MIMIC-III, our model is competitive to a fine-tuned BERT at a\ntiny fraction of its computational effort.\n\nPublished: 2020-11-16\nTitle: GGPONC: A Corpus of German Medical Text with Rich Metadata Based on Clinical Practice Guidelines\nAuthors: Florian Borchert, Christina Lohr, Luise Modersohn, Thomas Langer, Markus Follmann, Jan Philipp Sachs, Udo Hahn, Matthieu-P.

This corpus is one of the largest ever built from German medical\ndocuments.

Eye tracking, a technology that monitors and records the\nmovement of the eyes, provides valuable insights into human visual attention\npatterns. This technology can transform how healthcare professionals and\nmedical specialists engage with and analyze diagnostic images, offering a more\ninsightful and efficient approach to medical diagnostics. Hence, extracting\nmeaningful features and insights from medical images by leveraging eye-gaze\ndata improves our understanding of how radiologists and other medical experts\nmonitor, interpret, and understand images for diagnostic purposes. Eye-tracking\ndata, with intricate human visual attention patterns embedded, provides a\nbridge to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) development and human\ncognition. This integration allows novel methods to incorporate domain\nknowledge into machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches to\nenhance their alignment with human-like perception and decision-making.\nMoreover, extensive collections of eye-tracking data have also enabled novel\nML/DL methods to analyze human visual patterns, paving the way to a better\nunderstanding of human vision, attention, and cognition.

However, establishing specificity in cancer\ndiagnosis using gene expression data continues to pose challenges due to the\nhigh dimensionality and complexity of the data. Here we present models of deep\nlearning (DL) and apply them to gene expression data for the diagnosis and\ncategorization of cancer. In this study, we have developed two DL models using\nmessenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) datasets available from the Genomic Data\nCommons repository. Our models achieved 98% accuracy in cancer detection, with\nfalse negative and false positive rates below 1.7%. In our results, we\ndemonstrated that 18 out of 32 cancer-typing classifications achieved more than\n90% accuracy. Due to the limitation of a small sample size (less than 50\nobservations), certain cancers could not achieve a higher accuracy in typing\nclassification, but still achieved high accuracy for the cancer detection task.\nTo validate our models, we compared them with traditional statistical models.\nThe main advantage of our models over traditional cancer detection is the\nability to use data from various cancer types to automatically form features to\nenhance the detection and diagnosis of a specific cancer type.\n\nPublished: 2013-01-08\nTitle: Fuzzy Soft Set Based Classification for Gene Expression Data\nAuthors: N.

It requires significant attention, as early detection during the\nprecancerous stage provides an opportunity for a cure. The screening and\ndiagnosis of cervical cancer rely on cytology and colposcopy methods. Deep\nlearning, a promising technology in computer vision, has emerged as a potential\nsolution to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cervical cancer screening\ncompared to traditional clinical inspection methods that are prone to human\nerror. This review article discusses cervical cancer and its screening\nprocesses, followed by the Deep Learning training process and the\nclassification, segmentation, and detection tasks for cervical cancer\ndiagnosis. Additionally, we explored the most common public datasets used in\nboth cytology and colposcopy and highlighted the popular and most utilized\narchitectures that researchers have applied to both cytology and colposcopy. We\nreviewed 24 selected practical papers in this study and summarized them. This\narticle highlights the remarkable efficiency in enhancing the precision and\nspeed of cervical cancer analysis by Deep Learning, bringing us closer to early\ndiagnosis and saving lives.; Answer: task complete.

We use the quantum\napproximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to solve the syndrome decoding\nproblem with elegantly-designed generator- and check-based cost Hamiltonians\nfor classical and quantum codes. Simulations of the level-4 check-based QAOA\ndecoding of the [7,4,3] Hamming code, as well as the level-4 generator-based\nQAOA decoding of the [[5,1,3]] quantum code, demonstrate decoding performances\nthat match the maximum likelihood decoding. In addition, we show that a\ncombinatorial optimization problem with additional redundant clauses may be\nmore suitable for QAOA, while the number of qubits remains the same.\nFurthermore, we show that the QAOA decoding of a quantum code is inherently\ndegenerate. That is, degenerate errors of comparable weight will be returned by\nQAOA with comparable probability. This is supported by simulations of the\ngenerator-based QAOA decoding of the [[9,1,3]] Shor code.\n\nPublished: 2022-06-06\nTitle: Bridging Classical and Quantum with SDP initialized warm-starts for QAOA\nAuthors: Reuben Tate, Majid Farhadi, Creston Herold, Greg Mohler, Swati Gupta\nSummary: We study the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in the context\nof the Max-Cut problem. Near-term (noisy) quantum devices are only able to\n(accurately) execute QAOA at low circuit depths while QAOA requires a\nrelatively high circuit-depth in order to "see" the whole graph. We introduce a\nclassical pre-processing step that initializes QAOA with a biased superposition\nof all possible cuts in the graph, referred to as a warm-start. In particular,\nour initialization informs QAOA by a solution to a low-rank semidefinite\nprogramming relaxation of the Max-Cut problem. Our experimental results show\nthat this variant of QAOA, called QAOA-Warm, is able to outperform standard\nQAOA on lower circuit depths with less training time (in the optimization stage\nfor QAOA\'s variational parameters). We provide experimental evidence as well as\ntheoretical intuition on performance of the proposed framework.\n\nPublished: 2022-09-07\nTitle: Systematic study on the dependence of the warm-start quantum approximate optimization algorithm on approximate solutions\nAuthors: Ken N. Okada, Hirofumi Nishi, Taichi Kosugi, Yu-ichiro Matsushita\nSummary: Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithm to solve combinatorial optimization problems in the\nera of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. Recently warm-start\napproaches have been proposed to improve the performance of QAOA, where\napproximate solutions are obtained by classical algorithms in advance and\nincorporated into the initial state and/or unitary ansatz. In this work, we\nstudy in detail how the accuracy of approximate solutions affect the\nperformance of the warm-start QAOA (WS-QAOA). We numerically find that in\ntypical MAX-CUT problems, WS-QAOA tends to outperform QAOA as approximate\nsolutions become closer to the exact solutions in terms of the Hamming\ndistance. We reveal that this could be quantitatively attributed to the initial\nstate of the ansatz. We also solve MAX-CUT problems by WS-QAOA with approximate\nsolutions obtained via QAOA, having a better result than QAOA especially when\nthe circuit is relatively shallow. We believe that our study may deepen\nunderstanding of the performance of WS-QAOA and also provide a guide as to the\nnecessary quality of approximate solutions.; Answer: task complete.

The intermittent nature of production by renewable energy\nproducers implies that they rely on non-renewable producers so that the\naggregate power delivered meets the promised quality of service. This implicit\ninsurance provided by the non-renewable power sector to consumers is not\ncurrently priced and leads to an often ignored, hidden monetary transfer from\nnon-renewable producers to renewable producers. As the fraction of energy\nsupplied by renewable resources increases, these externalities also increase.\nIn this paper, we quantify these externalities by developing the market\nclearing price of energy in the presence of renewable energy. We consider a\nday-ahead electricity market where renewable and non-renewable generators bid\nby proposing their asking price per unit of energy to an independent system\noperator (ISO). The ISO\'s problem is a multi-stage stochastic optimization\nproblem to dispatch energy from each generator to minimize the cost of\npurchased energy on behalf of the consumers. We incorporate the notion of load\nvariance using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVAR) measure in the day-ahead\nelectricity market to ensure that the generators are able to meet the load\nwithin a desired confidence level. We analytically derive the market clearing\nprice of energy as a function of CVAR. It is shown that a higher penetration\nlevel of the renewable energies may increase the market clearing price of\nenergy.\n\nPublished: 2019-11-05\nTitle: Control Strategies for Microgrids with Renewable Energy Generation and Battery Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Wenhao Zhuo\nSummary: In this report, several control strategies for microgrids with renewable\nenergy resources and battery energy storage systems are proposed. Renewable\nenergy has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions, while higher\npenetration of renewable energy is hindered by the inherent variability and\nintermittency of renewable resources. This motivates the development of\nmicrogrids supplied by renewable energy resources. With proper control of\nstorage units and communications with the energy market, the non-dispatchable\nenergy can be regulated to reduce the difficulty of power scheduling in the\ngrid operation. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are widely used to make\nrenewable energy more controllable and usable on demand. With suitable\nprediction techniques and control algorithms, BESS can store part of the\ngenerated renewable energy and supply some stored energy at different periods,\nso that the actual power dispatched can meet the required operating criteria.\nThe control algorithms introduced in this report are developed to maximize the\nprofit and minimize the energy cost in microgrids, which require predicted data\non renewable power, temperature, electricity price, and load demand.\n\nPublished: 2022-06-28\nTitle: The Benefits of Hydrogen Energy Transmission and Conversion Systems to the Renewable Power Grids: Day-ahead Unit Commitment\nAuthors: Jin Lu, Xingpeng Li\nSummary: The curtailment of renewable energy is more frequently observed as the\nrenewable penetration levels are rising rapidly in modern power systems. It is\na waste of free and green renewable energy and implies current power grids are\nunable to accommodate more renewable sources. One major reason is that higher\npower transmission capacity is required for higher renewable penetration level.\nAnother major reason is the volatility of the renewable generation.

It is estimated that 70% of the world population will live in\nurban areas by 2050. The electric grid is the energy backbone of smart city\ndeployments. An electric energy system immune to adverse events, both cyber and\nphysical risks, and able to support the integration of renewable sources will\ndrive a transformational development approach for future smart cities. This\narticle describes how the future electric energy system with 100% electricity\nsupply from renewable energy sources requires the "birth of security and\nresiliency" incorporated with its ecosystem.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-25\nTitle: Strategizing EV Charging and Renewable Integration in Texas\nAuthors: Mohammad Mohammadi, Jesse Thornburg\nSummary: Exploring the convergence of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, and\nsmart grid technologies in the context of Texas, this study addresses\nchallenges hindering the widespread adoption of EVs. Acknowledging their\nenvironmental benefits, the research focuses on grid stability concerns,\nuncoordinated charging patterns, and the complicated relationship between EVs\nand renewable energy sources. Dynamic time warping (DTW) clustering and k-means\nclustering methodologies categorize days based on total load and net load,\noffering nuanced insights into daily electricity consumption and renewable\nenergy generation patterns. By establishing optimal charging and\nvehicle-to-grid (V2G) windows tailored to specific load characteristics, the\nstudy provides a sophisticated methodology for strategic decision-making in\nenergy consumption and renewable integration. The findings contribute to the\nongoing discourse on achieving a sustainable and resilient energy future\nthrough the seamless integration of EVs into smart grids.\n\nPublished: 2016-06-03\nTitle: Distributed Real-Time Power Balancing in Renewable-Integrated Power Grids with Storage and Flexible Loads\nAuthors: Sun Sun, Min Dong, Ben Liang\nSummary: The large-scale integration of renewable generation directly affects the\nreliability of power grids. We investigate the problem of power balancing in a\ngeneral renewable-integrated power grid with storage and flexible loads. We\nconsider a power grid that is supplied by one conventional generator (CG) and\nmultiple renewable generators (RGs) each co-located with storage,and is\nconnected with external markets. An aggregator operates the power grid to\nmaintain power balance between supply and demand. Aiming at minimizing the\nlong-term system cost, we first propose a real-time centralized power balancing\nsolution, taking into account the uncertainty of the renewable generation,\nloads, and energy prices. We then provide a distributed implementation\nalgorithm, significantly reducing both computational burden and communication\noverhead. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal\nas the storage capacity increases and the CG ramping constraint loosens.\nMoreover, the distributed implementation enjoys a fast convergence rate, and\nenables each RG and the aggregator to make their own decisions. Simulation\nshows that our proposed algorithm outperforms alternatives and can achieve\nnear-optimal performance for a wide range of storage capacity.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-12\nTitle: Exploring the impact of social stress on the adaptive dynamics of COVID-19: Typing the behavior of naïve populations faced with epidemics\nAuthors: Innokentiy Kastalskiy, Andrei Zinovyev, Evgeny Mirkes, Victor Kazantsev, Alexander N. Gorban\nSummary: In the context of natural disasters, human responses inevitably intertwine\nwith natural factors. The COVID-19 pandemic, as a significant stress factor,\nhas brought to light profound variations among different countries in terms of\ntheir adaptive dynamics in addressing the spread of infection outbreaks across\ndifferent regions. This emphasizes the crucial role of cultural characteristics\nin natural disaster analysis. The theoretical understanding of large-scale\nepidemics primarily relies on mean-field kinetic models. However, conventional\nSIR-like models failed to fully explain the observed phenomena at the onset of\nthe COVID-19 outbreak. These phenomena included the unexpected cessation of\nexponential growth, the reaching of plateaus, and the occurrence of multi-wave\ndynamics. In situations where an outbreak of a highly virulent and unfamiliar\ninfection arises, it becomes crucial to respond swiftly at a non-medical level\nto mitigate the negative socio-economic impact. Here we present a theoretical\nexamination of the first wave of the epidemic based on a simple SIRSS model\n(SIR with Social Stress). We conduct an analysis of the socio-cul; Answer: task complete.

Golan, Benjamin D. Trump, Jeffrey C. Cegan, Igor Linkov\nSummary: The COVID19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of resilience in supply chains,\nas global networks fail from disruptions at single nodes and connections.\nThrough an overview of the existing vaccine and pharmaceutical supply chain\npublications focusing on resilience, as well as recent papers reporting\nmodeling of resilience in supply chains across multiple fields, we find that\nmodels for supply chain resilience are few and most of them are focused on\nindividual dimensions of resilience rather than on comprehensive strategy\nnecessary for scaling up vaccine production and distribution in emergency\nsettings. We find that COVID19 resulted in a wave of interest to supply chain\nresilience, but publications from 2020 are narrow in focus and largely\nqualitative in nature; evidence-based models and measures are rare. Further,\npublications often focus exclusively on specific portions of the specific\nsupply chain of interest, excluding associated supporting networks, such as\ntransportation, social and command and control (C2) necessary for vaccine\nproduction and equitable distribution. This lack of network analysis is a major\ngap in the literature that needs to be bridged in order to create methods of\nreal-time analysis and decision tools for the COVID19 vaccine supply chain. We\nconclude that a comprehensive, quantitative approach to network resilience that\nencompasses the supply chain in the context of other social and physical\nnetworks is needed in order to address the emerging challenges of a large-scale\nCOVID-19 vaccination program. We further find that the COVID-19 pandemic\nunderscores the necessity of positioning supply chain resilience within a\nmulti-network context and formally incorporating temporal dimensions into\nanalysis through the NAS definition of resilience, plan, absorb, recover,\nadapt, to ensure essential needs are met across all dimensions of society.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-16\nTitle: Evaluating Supply Chain Resilience During Pandemic Using Agent-based Simulation\nAuthors: Teddy Lazebnik\nSummary: Recent pandemics have highlighted vulnerabilities in our global economic\nsystems, especially supply chains. Possible future pandemic raises a dilemma\nfor businesses owners between short-term profitability and long-term supply\nchain resilience planning. In this study, we propose a novel agent-based\nsimulation model integrating extended Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)\nepidemiological model and supply and demand economic model to evaluate supply\nchain resilience strategies during pandemics. Using this model, we explore a\nrange of supply chain resilience strategies under pandemic scenarios using in\nsilico experiments. We find that a balanced approach to supply chain resilience\nperforms better in both pandemic and non-pandemic times compared to extreme\nstrategies, highlighting the importance of preparedness in the form of a better\nsupply chain resilience. However, our analysis shows that the exact supply\nchain resilience strategy is hard to obtain for each firm and is relatively\nsensitive to the exact profile of the pandemic and economic state at the\nbeginning of the pandemic. As such, we used a machine learning model that uses\nthe agent-based simulation to estimate a near-optimal supply chain resilience\nstrategy for a firm. The proposed model offers insights for policymakers and\nbusinesses to enhance supply chain resilience in the face of future pandemics,\ncontributing to understanding the trade-offs between short-term gains and\nlong-term sustainability in supply chain management before and during\npandemics.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-18\nTitle: Evaluation of key impression of resilient supply chain based on artificial intelligence of things (AIoT)\nAuthors: Alireza Aliahmadi, Hamed Nozari, Javid Ghahremani-Nahr, Agnie; Answer: task complete.

We\nconclude that a comprehensive, quantitative approach to network resilience that\nencompasses the supply chain in the context of other social and physical\nnetworks is needed in order to address the emerging challenges of a large-scale\nCOVID-19 vaccination program. We further find that the COVID-19 pandemic\nunderscores the necessity of positioning supply chain resilience within a\nmulti-network context and formally incorporating temporal dimensions into\nanalysis through the NAS definition of resilience, plan, absorb, recover,\nadapt, to ensure essential needs are met across all dimensions of society.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-16\nTitle: Evaluating Supply Chain Resilience During Pandemic Using Agent-based Simulation\nAuthors: Teddy Lazebnik\nSummary: Recent pandemics have highlighted vulnerabilities in our global economic\nsystems, especially supply chains. Possible future pandemic raises a dilemma\nfor businesses owners between short-term profitability and long-term supply\nchain resilience planning. In this study, we propose a novel agent-based\nsimulation model integrating extended Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)\nepidemiological model and supply and demand economic model to evaluate supply\nchain resilience strategies during pandemics. Using this model, we explore a\nrange of supply chain resilience strategies under pandemic scenarios using in\nsilico experiments. We find that a balanced approach to supply chain resilience\nperforms better in both pandemic and non-pandemic times compared to extreme\nstrategies, highlighting the importance of preparedness in the form of a better\nsupply chain resilience. However, our analysis shows that the exact supply\nchain resilience strategy is hard to obtain for each firm and is relatively\nsensitive to the exact profile of the pandemic and economic state at the\nbeginning of the pandemic. As such, we used a machine learning model that uses\nthe agent-based simulation to estimate a near-optimal supply chain resilience\nstrategy for a firm. The proposed model offers insights for policymakers and\nbusinesses to enhance supply chain resilience in the face of future pandemics,\ncontributing to understanding the trade-offs between short-term gains and\nlong-term sustainability in supply chain management before and during\npandemics.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-18\nTitle: Evaluation of key impression of resilient supply chain based on artificial intelligence of things (AIoT)\nAuthors: Alireza Aliahmadi, Hamed Nozari, Javid Ghahremani-Nahr, Agnie; Answer: task complete.

Quach, Giulio Cerullo, Tersilla Virgili\nSummary: According to the International Energy Agency, each human uses more than 80 GJ\nof energy per year; this is equivalent to leaving a washing machine\ncontinuously running for one year for every person on Earth. This consumption\nis expected to increase by 28% by 2040 (from 2015 levels). The majority (86%)\nof this energy comes from fossil fuels. This dependence on fossil fuels comes\nwith major environmental costs, with climate change arguably being the greatest\nchallenge facing our era. Renewable energy offers a possible solution. However,\nrenewable energy sources, like solar and wind are not continuous sources, and\ntherefore energy storage technology or batteries, remain an urgent challenge\nfor further worldwide adoption of renewable energy. Alongside the need for\nefficient batteries to store renewable energy, the portability of batteries\nmakes them an essential component in mobile technologies, including electric\nvehicles. Current batteries operate on the basis of well-understood\nelectrochemical principles which were developed two centuries ago. While there\nis an ongoing intense effort aimed at improving their performance through\noptimization of the materials and the device architecture, it is worth\nexploring completely novel and disruptive approaches towards energy storage.\nQuantum batteries are energy storage devices that utilise quantum mechanics to\nenhance performance or functionality. While they are still in their infancy\nwith only proof-of-principle demonstrations achieved, their radically\ninnovative design principles offer a potential solution to future energy\nchallenges.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-11-05\nTitle: Control Strategies for Microgrids with Renewable Energy Generation and Battery Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Wenhao Zhuo\nSummary: In this report, several control strategies for microgrids with renewable\nenergy resources and battery energy storage systems are proposed. Renewable\nenergy has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions, while higher\npenetration of renewable energy is hindered by the inherent variability and\nintermittency of renewable resources. This motivates the development of\nmicrogrids supplied by renewable energy resources. With proper control of\nstorage units and communications with the energy market, the non-dispatchable\nenergy can be regulated to reduce the difficulty of power scheduling in the\ngrid operation.

This is essential for domains such as medical imaging, where\nlabels are costly and time-consuming to curate. However, the most effective\nsupervised or SSL strategy for transferring models to different healthcare\nsystems or novel tasks is not well understood. In this work, we systematically\nexperiment with a variety of supervised and self-supervised pretraining\nstrategies using multimodal datasets of medical images (chest X-rays) and text\n(radiology reports). We then evaluate their performance on data from two\nexternal institutions with diverse sets of tasks. In addition, we experiment\nwith different transfer learning strategies to effectively adapt these\npretrained models to new tasks and healthcare systems. Our empirical results\nsuggest that multimodal SSL gives substantial gains over unimodal SSL in\nperformance across new healthcare systems and tasks, comparable to models\npretrained with full supervision. We demonstrate additional performance gains\nwith models further adapted to the new dataset and task, using multimodal\ndomain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT), linear probing then finetuning (LP-FT), and\nboth methods combined. We offer suggestions for alternative models to use in\nscenarios where not all of these additions are feasible. Our results provide\nguidance for improving the generalization of medical image interpretation\nmodels to new healthcare systems and novel tasks.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-04\nTitle: Transfer Learning for Clinical Time Series Analysis using Deep Neural Networks\nAuthors: Priyanka Gupta, Pankaj Malhotra, Jyoti Narwariya, Lovekesh Vig, Gautam Shroff\nSummary: Deep neural networks have shown promising results for various clinical\nprediction tasks. However, training deep networks such as those based on\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) requires large labeled data, significant\nhyper-parameter tuning effort and expertise, and high computational resources.\nIn this work, we investigate as to what extent can transfer learning address\nthese issues when using deep RNNs to model multivariate clinical time series.\nWe consider two scenarios for transfer learning using RNNs: i)\ndomain-adaptation, i.e., leveraging a deep RNN - namely, TimeNet - pre-trained\nfor feature extraction on time series from diverse domains, and adapting it for\nfeature extraction and subsequent target tasks in healthcare domain, ii)\ntask-adaptation, i.e., pre-training a deep RNN - namely, HealthNet - on diverse\ntasks in healthcare domain, and adapting it to new target tasks in the same\ndomain. We evaluate the above approaches on publicly available MIMIC-III\nbenchmark dataset, and demonstrate that (a) computationally-efficient linear\nmodels trained using features extracted via pre-trained RNNs outperform or, in\nthe worst case, perform as well as deep RNNs and statistical hand-crafted\nfeatures based models trained specifically for target task; (b) models obtained\nby adapting pre-trained models for target tasks are significantly more robust\nto the size of labeled data compared to task-specific RNNs, while also being\ncomputationally efficient. We, therefore, conclude that pre-trained deep models\nlike TimeNet and HealthNet allow leveraging the advantages of deep learning for\nclinical time series analysis tasks, while also minimize dependence on\nhand-crafted features, deal robustly with scarce labeled training data\nscenarios without overfitting, as well as reduce dependence on expertise and\nresources required to train deep networks from scratch.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-28\nTitle: Developing Healthcare Language Model Embedding Spaces\nAuthors: Niall Taylor, Dan Schofield, Andrey Kormilitzin, Dan W Joyce, Alejo Nevado-Holgado\nSumm; Answer: task complete.

The overall goal is to\nreduce the total operating costs and the carbon emissions for a future\nresidential house, while satisfying the end-users comfort levels. This paper\nmodels a wide variety of home appliances and formulates the economic operation\nproblem using mixed integer linear programming. Case studies are performed to\nvalidate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution algorithm.\nSimulation results also show the positive impact of dispatchable loads,\ndistributed renewable generators, and distributed energy storage devices on a\nfuture residential house.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.; Answer: task complete.

This paper\nmodels a wide variety of home appliances and formulates the economic operation\nproblem using mixed integer linear programming. Case studies are performed to\nvalidate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution algorithm.\nSimulation results also show the positive impact of dispatchable loads,\ndistributed renewable generators, and distributed energy storage devices on a\nfuture residential house.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.; Answer: task complete.
