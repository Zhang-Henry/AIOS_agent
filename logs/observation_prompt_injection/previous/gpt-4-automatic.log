As quantum computing architectures advance\nand become more widely available, lower-level, system software infrastructures\nwill be needed to enable tighter, co-processor programming and access models.\nHere we present XACC, a system-level software infrastructure for\nquantum-classical computing that promotes a service-oriented architecture to\nexpose interfaces for core quantum programming, compilation, and execution\ntasks.

We provide concrete examples demonstrating the\nutility of this framework with paradigmatic tasks.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2019-11-06\nTitle: XACC: A System-Level Software Infrastructure for Heterogeneous Quantum-Classical Computing\nAuthors: Alexander J.
