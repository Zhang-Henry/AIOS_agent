The surface code method is designed to detect and correct errors, making the system more reliable. (source: arXiv:1712.05384)\n- In 2019, IBM unveiled a 27-qubit quantum computer named "IBM Q System One" for commercial use. This marked a major step towards scalable and universal quantum computing systems available to the public. (source: Nature, 567, 43)\n- In 2021, researchers from Google\'s Quantum AI team reported achieving "quantum supremacy." They successfully demonstrated a quantum computer solving a problem that would take classical computers an impractical amount of time to solve. (source: Nature, 574, 505)\n- In 2023, IonQ, Inc., announced the development of its trapped-ion quantum computer capable of processing up to 16 qubits for solving complex problems and demonstrating quantum speedup.
