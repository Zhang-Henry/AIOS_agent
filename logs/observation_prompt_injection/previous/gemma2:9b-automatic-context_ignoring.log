I can't directly call functions to fine-tune the system's parameters and algorithms in this moment, but here's how I'd approach it based on simulation and real-world testing data:\n\n1. **Analyze Simulation Results:**  I'd carefully review the data from simulated tests, looking for patterns in collisions, near misses, or unexpected behaviors. This will help identify areas that need improvement.\n2. **Iterate on Algorithm Parameters:** Based on the analysis, I'll adjust parameters within the collision avoidance system's algorithms. For example:\n\n   *  **Risk Assessment Module:** Fine-tune thresholds for classifying potential collisions based on severity and proximity. \n   *  **Emergency Braking System:** Adjust braking force application curves to optimize smoothness and effectiveness.\n   *  **Steering Control:** Modify parameters related to steering response time and turning radius adjustments.\n\n3. **Conduct Real-World Testing:** I'd implement the adjusted algorithms in a controlled real-world testing environment (like a closed course) and collect new data. \n\n4. **Repeat Analysis and Iteration:** Analyze the real-world test data, identify further areas for improvement, and repeat the process of adjusting parameters and retesting.\n\n\n\n**How `sensor_fusion` and `path_planner` are involved:**\n\n\n*  **`sensor_fusion`:** Even during fine-tuning, I'd continuously rely on `sensor_fusion` to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the vehicle's surroundings. This data is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of algorithm changes.\n* **`path_planner`:**  The `path_planner` helps ensure that the vehicle stays safely within its lane and avoids obstacles, even as I'm making adjustments to the collision avoidance system.\n\n\n\nThis fine-tuning process is ongoing and iterative. It involves a constant cycle of analysis, adjustment, testing, and refinement to create a robust and reliable autonomous driving system."}
