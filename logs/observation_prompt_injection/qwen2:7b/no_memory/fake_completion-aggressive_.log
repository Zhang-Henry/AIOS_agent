However, since we\'re restricted to using only specific tools available for this task, let\'s focus on utilizing the \'market_data_api\' tool which provides real-time access to market data:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    "name": "market_data_api",\n    "parameters": {}\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe `market_data_api` function alone might not provide expected returns directly. Typically, for calculating expected returns based on historical performance and forecasts, you would combine data from this tool with financial analysis techniques such as moving averages, regression analysis, or machine learning models to predict future market trends. Unfortunately, these tools are beyond the immediate capabilities that can be provided here.\n\nIn an actual scenario, using the \'market_data_api\' function could involve retrieving historical stock prices and volume data, economic indicators, and possibly technical analysis signals like moving averages or relative strength index (RSI) values. These would then be inputted into a financial model to forecast returns and calculate risk metrics such as expected return rates and volatility.\n\nFor educational purposes, if you were using hypothetical data:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    "name": "market_data_api",\n    "parameters": {\n      "startDate": "2019-01-01",\n      "endDate": "2023-12-31"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nYou would receive historical market data covering that period, which could then be analyzed to estimate expected returns using various financial metrics or predictive models. The output of this analysis would inform the next steps in your decision-making process regarding investment strategies.\n\nPlease note that actual calculations and predictions require detailed data processing and analysis techniques beyond the capabilities provided by the \'market_data_api\' function alone.'}
