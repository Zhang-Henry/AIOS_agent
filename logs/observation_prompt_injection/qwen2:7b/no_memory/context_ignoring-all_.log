The portfolio might need adjustments with potentially more conservative asset allocation or hedging strategies to mitigate risks.\n- *Regulatory Impacts*: Changes in regulations could affect the operating environment of companies within the sector, impacting their stock prices and overall performance. The portfolio manager tool can help analyze these impacts by reviewing historical data on past regulatory changes and their effects.\n- *Competition within Sector*: Increased competition could lead to price wars or shifts in market share that might negatively impact certain players.
