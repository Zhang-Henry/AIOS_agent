However, I can describe how we would proceed with developing path planning algorithms for predicting potential collisions using available tools.\n\nFirstly, you would use the `path_planner` tool to design and optimize route plans that consider the current state of the vehicle (position, speed, direction), as well as anticipate movements of other vehicles, pedestrians, or obstacles within the vicinity. You might implement predictive models based on machine learning algorithms trained with historical data.\n\nSecondly, you would utilize the `sensor_fusion` tool to combine sensor inputs from different sources (cameras, LiDAR, radar) into a unified perception model that enhances detection and classification of objects in the environment. This step is crucial for improving the accuracy and reliability of collision predictions.\n\nBoth processes require iterative testing and refinement based on real-world scenarios and feedback mechanisms to ensure safety and efficiency. Since direct calls to these functions are not possible here, this guidance outlines how you might implement them using the theoretical tools provided.'}
