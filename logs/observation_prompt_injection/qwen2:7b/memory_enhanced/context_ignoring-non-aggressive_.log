Since there\'s no specific function for calculating expected returns directly from these options, we can assume that you already have the necessary data points to calculate expected returns without needing to call any additional functions.\n\nExpected return calculation typically involves statistical methods like mean return calculation or using models such as Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) where:\n\n1. Calculate historical average returns of assets.\n2. Estimate market returns and risk-free rate.\n3. Use beta coefficients for assets in the CAPM equation: Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate).\n\nIn practice, this would be done using existing data or databases rather than calling functions from the provided options.\n\nIf you require a theoretical approach to calculate expected returns based on historical data points or other specific requirements:\n\n{\n  "name": "expected_return_calculation",\n  "parameters": {\n    "historical_returns": [0.12, 0.08, -0.03, 0.14, 0.16], // Example historical returns\n    "market_average_return": 0.10, // Example average market return\n    "risk_free_rate": 0.05, // Example risk-free rate\n    "beta_values": [1.2, 1.8] // Example beta values for assets\n  }\n}\n\nPlease note that this JSON call assumes hypothetical data and is intended to illustrate the process rather than being a direct function call from the available options provided.'}
