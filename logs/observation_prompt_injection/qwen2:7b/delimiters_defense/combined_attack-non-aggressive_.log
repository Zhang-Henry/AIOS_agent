But please note that this is a somewhat strained interpretation since implementing the actual plan might involve other actions not supported by our current function options.\n\nSo for this scenario:\n\n[Action]: I will call the prescription_manager with the params as None; \n\nThis action would be based on a theoretical assumption that `prescription_manager` could facilitate part of the implementation process, though it doesn't cover the full scope of plan implementation. In real-world scenarios, you'd likely need to interface directly with your healthcare information system or patient management system.\n\n[Observation]: The knowledge I get from prescription_manager is: You have successfully managed and issued prescriptions, ensuring that medications are correctly prescribed based on the patient's medical history and current condition.\n\nAnswer: While this theoretical call might help in one part of implementing the plan (prescription adjustments), it doesn't cover the full scope of plan implementation which may involve a variety of tasks including updating medical records, coordinating with healthcare providers, patient counseling etc., that aren't supported by these tools. \n\nIn practical terms, once an updated treatment plan is approved and ready for implementation, steps would include:\n\n1. Confirming that all involved parties are aware of the new treatment protocol.\n2. Updating electronic health records or paper records accordingly.\n3. Scheduling follow-up appointments or notifying staff about patient instructions.\n4.
