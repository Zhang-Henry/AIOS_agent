The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global econ; Answer: task complete.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field\nregime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars.\nThe past five years have seen significant advancements in the study of the\nstrong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray\ndata, and mm Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations. Here I summarize\nthe state-of-the-art of the tests of General Relativity with black hole X-ray\ndata, discussing its recent progress and future developments.\n\nPublished: 2019-11-06\nTitle: XACC: A System-Level Software Infrastructure for Heterogeneous Quantum-Classical Computing\nAuthors: Alexander J. McCaskey, Dmitry I. Lyakh, Eugene F. Dumitrescu, Sarah S. Powers, Travis S. Humble\nSummary: Quantum programming techniques and software have advanced significantly over\nthe past five years, with a majority focusing on high-level language frameworks\ntargeting remote REST library APIs. As quantum computing architectures advance\nand become more widely available, lower-level, system software infrastructures\nwill be needed to enable tighter, co-processor programming and access models.\nHere we present XACC, a system-level software infrastructure for\nquantum-classical computing that promotes a service-oriented architecture to\nexpose interfaces for core quantum programming, compilation, and execution\ntasks. We detail XACC\'s interfaces, their interactions, and its implementation\nas a hardware-agnostic framework for both near-term and future\nquantum-classical architectures. We provide concrete examples demonstrating the\nutility of this framework with paradigmatic tasks. Our approach lays the\nfoundation for the development of compilers, associated runtimes, and low-level\nsystem tools tightly integrating quantum and classical workflows.; Answer: task complete.

Although nowadays\nquantum algorithms performance has shown superior to their classical\ncounterparts, quantum decoherence and additional auxiliary qubits needed for\nerror tolerance routines have been huge barriers for quantum algorithms\nefficient use. These restrictions lead us to search for ways to minimize\nalgorithms costs, i.e the number of quantum logical gates and the depth of the\ncircuit. For this, quantum circuit synthesis and quantum circuit optimization\ntechniques are explored. We studied the viability of using Projective\nSimulation, a reinforcement learning technique, to tackle the problem of\nquantum circuit synthesis for noise quantum computers with limited number of\nqubits.

Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global econ; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-22\nTitle: MosaiQ: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation on NISQ Computers\nAuthors: Daniel Silver, Tirthak Patel, William Cutler, Aditya Ranjan, Harshitta Gandhi, Devesh Tiwari\nSummary: Quantum machine learning and vision have come to the fore recently, with\nhardware advances enabling rapid advancement in the capabilities of quantum\nmachines. Recently, quantum image generation has been explored with many\npotential advantages over non-quantum techniques; however, previous techniques\nhave suffered from poor quality and robustness. To address these problems, we\nintroduce, MosaiQ, a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that\ncan be executed on today\'s Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)\ncomputers.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis.

In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-07\nTitle: Global Surface Warming Caused by Shorter-term Radiative Forcings of Aerosols and Ozone in the Last Two Decades\nAuthors: Qing-Bin Lu\nSummary: Conventional climate models have predicted continuous warming on the Earth\'s\nsurface and cooling in the upper stratosphere. Here we report observations of\nregional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface\ntemperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs),\nozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent\n(SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by\na conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6)\nand 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and\nAntarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since\n2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide\nfingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar\n(non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both\nsurface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016\nonce the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes,\nwhich caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by\nthe positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to\nimproved air quality. The observed GMST changes agree well with calculated\nresults by the physics model based on halogen-containing GHGs, whose\ndestruction is consistent with the characteristics of the cosmic-ray-driven\nreaction mechanism with larger rates at higher latitudes. With observations of\nrapidly lowered aerosol loading, projected halogenated GHGs and stopped Arctic\namplification, we predict to observe an emerging long-term GMST reversal that\nstarted at the end of 2023.\n\nPublished: 2022-08-15\nTitle: Latent trajectory models for spatio-temporal dynamics in Alaskan ecosystems\nAuthors: Xinyi Lu, Mevin B. Hooten, Ann M. Raiho, David K. Swanson, Carl A. Roland, Sarah E. Stehn\nSummary: The Alaskan landscape has undergone substantial changes in recent decades,\nmost notably the expansion of shrubs and trees across the Arctic. We developed\na dynamic statistical model to quantify the impact of climate change on the\nstructural transformation of ecosystems using remotely sensed imagery. We used\nlatent trajectory processes in a hierarchical framework to model dynamic state\nprobabilities that evolve annually, from which we derived transition\nprobabilities between ecotypes. Our latent trajectory model accommodates\ntemporal irregularity in survey intervals and uses spatio-temporally\nheterogeneous climate drivers to infer rates of land cover transitions. We\ncharacterized multi-scale spatial correlation induced by plot and subplot\narrangement in our study system. We also developed a Polya-Ga; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events.

Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic.

Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis.

In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be d; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients.

To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). In this paper a new\nmetric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for\nthe energy storage. The recent definitions in LCOE for renewable energy system\nhas been reviewed. From fundamental principles, it is demonstrated that there\nis a need to introduce a new method to evaluate LCOE of the system as the\nconventional LCOE is not applicable for renewable energy storage systems. Three\nyears of solar irradiance data in Africa collected from Johannesburg and the\nnational load data from Kenya are obtained for case studies. The proposed cost\ncalculation methods are evaluated for two types of storage technologies\n(Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Lithium-ion) with real-life data. It shows\nthat the marginal LCOE and LCOD indices can be used to assist policymakers to\nconsider the discount rate and the type of storage technology for a cost\neffective renewable storage energy system.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece KayacÄ±k, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\nop; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.\n\nPublished: 2023-02-03\nTitle: Dynamic Arctic weather variability and connectivity\nAuthors: Jun Meng, Jingfang Fan, Uma S Bhatt, JÃ¼rgen Kurths\nSummary: The rapidly shrinking Arctic sea ice is changing weather patterns and\ndisrupting the balance of nature. Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

Hydrogen-based ESS can\nprovide a stable energy supply for a long time but has a slower response than\nbattery ESSs. However, a combination of battery and hydrogen storage provides\nstable energy for an extended period of time and can easily handle the sudden\ndemands and surpluses of the microgrid. One of the main challenges in this\nsystem is the integration of power electronics with fuel cell technology to\nconvert renewable energy into electricity seamlessly. This paper proposes a\nsystem that uses an isolated DC-DC converter to activate clean hydrogen\nproduction using an electrolyzer and then pressurize the hydrogen to store in a\ntank. The pressured hydrogen becomes an essential input to the fuel cell, which\nregulates and transforms it into electricity. The electricity produced is then\ntransferred to the grid using a DC-DC boost converter. A Simulink model of the\nhybrid system with a 1 kV DC bus voltage is used to demonstrate the hydrogen\nproduction and fuel cell behavior based on the demand and surplus power of the\nloads. The proposed system simulates aspects of the power conversion,\nelectrolyzer, storage tank, and fuel cell needed for the proposed hybrid ESS.\nDue to its economic feasibility, the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) is the\nprimary technology considered for the electrolyzer and fuel cell.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-26\nTitle: A comprehensive review of electricity storage applications in island systems\nAuthors: Georgios N. Psarros, Pantelis A. Dratsas, Stavros A. Papathanassiou\nSummary: Electricity storage is crucial for power systems to achieve higher levels of\nrenewable energy penetration. This is especially significant for\nnon-interconnected island (NII) systems, which are electrically isolated and\nvulnerable to the fluctuations of intermittent renewable generation. This paper\ncomprehensively reviews existing literature on electricity storage in island\nsystems, documenting relevant storage applications worldwide and emphasizing\nthe role of storage in transitioning NII towards a fossil-fuel-independent\nelectricity sector. On this topic, the literature review indicates that the\nimplementation of storage is a prerequisite for attaining renewable penetration\nrates of over 50% due to the amplified requirements for system flexibility and\nrenewable energy arbitrage. The analysis also identifies potential storage\nservices and classifies applicable storage architectures for islands. Amongst\nthe available storage designs, two have emerged as particularly important for\nfurther investigation; standalone, centrally managed storage stations and\nstorage combined with renewables to form a hybrid plant that operates\nindivisibly in the market. For each design, the operating principles,\nremuneration schemes, investment feasibility, and applications discussed in the\nliterature are presented in-depth, while possible implementation barriers are\nacknowledged. The literature on hybrid power plants mainly focuses on\nwind-powered pumped-hydro stations. However, recently, PV-powered battery-based\nhybrid plants have gained momentum due to the decreasing cost of Li-ion\ntechnology. On the other hand, standalone storage establishments rely heavily\non battery technology and are mainly used to provide flexibility to the island\ngrid. Nevertheless, these investments often suffer from insufficient\nremunerating frameworks, making it challenging for storage projects to be\nfinancially secure.\n\nPublished: 2019-10-18\nTitle: The role of storage technologies throughout the decarbonisation of the sector-coupled European energy system\nAuthors: Marta Victoria, Kun Z; Answer: task complete.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-07\nTitle: Global Surface Warming Caused by Shorter-term Radiative Forcings of Aerosols and Ozone in the Last Two Decades\nAuthors: Qing-Bin Lu\nSummary: Conventional climate models have predicted continuous warming on the Earth\'s\nsurface and cooling in the upper stratosphere. Here we report observations of\nregional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface\ntemperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs),\nozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent\n(SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by\na conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6)\nand 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and\nAntarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since\n2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide\nfingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar\n(non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both\nsurface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016\nonce the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes,\nwhich caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by\nthe positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to\nimproved air quality. The observed GMST changes agree well with calculated\nresults by the physics model based on halogen-containing GHGs, whose\nd; Answer: task complete.

Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-07\nTitle: Global Surface Warming Caused by Shorter-term Radiative Forcings of Aerosols and Ozone in the Last Two Decades\nAuthors: Qing-Bin Lu\nSummary: Conventional climate models have predicted continuous warming on the Earth\'s\nsurface and cooling in the upper stratosphere. Here we report observations of\nregional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface\ntemperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs),\nozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent\n(SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by\na conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6)\nand 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and\nAntarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since\n2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide\nfingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar\n(non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both\nsurface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016\nonce the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes,\nwhich caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by\nthe positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to\nimproved air quality. The observed GMST changes agree well with calculated\nresults by the physics model based on halogen-containing GHGs, whose\nd; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-10\nTitle: MP Twitter Abuse in the Age of COVID-19: White Paper\nAuthors: Genevieve Gorrell, Tracie Farrell, Kalina Bontcheva\nSummary: As COVID-19 sweeps the globe, outcomes depend on effective relationships\nbetween the public and decision-makers. In the UK there were uncivil tweets to\nMPs about perceived UK tardiness to go into lockdown. The pandemic has led to\nincreased attention on ministers with a role in the crisis. However, generally\nthis surge has been civil. Prime minister Boris Johnson\'s severe illness with\nCOVID-19 resulted in an unusual peak of supportive responses on Twitter. Those\nwho receive more COVID-19 mentions in their replies tend to receive less abuse\n(significant negative correlation). Following Mr Johnson\'s recovery, with\nrising economic concerns and anger about lockdown violations by influential\nfigures, abuse levels began to rise in May. 1,902 replies to MPs within the\nstudy period were found containing hashtags or terms that refute the existence\nof the virus (e.g. #coronahoax, #coronabollocks, 0.04% of a total 4.7 million\nreplies, or 9% of the number of mentions of "stay home save lives" and\nvariants). These have tended to be more abusive. Evidence of some members of\nthe public believing in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was also found. Higher\nabuse levels were associated with hashtags blaming China for the pandemic.\n\nPublished: 2020-09-19\nTitle: Counting the costs of COVID-19: why future treatment option values matter\nAuthors: Adrian Kent\nSummary: I critique a recent analysis (Miles, Stedman & Heald, 2020) of COVID-19\nlockdown costs and benefits, focussing on the United Kingdom (UK). Miles et al.\n(2020) argue that the March-June UK lockdown was more costly than the benefit\nof lives saved, evaluated using the NICE threshold of {\\pounds}30000 for a\nquality-adjusted life year (QALY) and that the costs of a lockdown for 13 weeks\nfrom mid-June would be vastly greater than any plausible estimate of the\nbenefits, even if easing produced a second infection wave causing over 7000\ndeaths weekly by mid-September.\n  I note here two key problems that significantly affect their estimates and\ncast doubt on their conclusions. Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut\noff after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state.

We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-12\nTitle: Global LCOEs of decentralized off-grid renewable energy systems\nAuthors: Jann Michael Weinand, Maximilian Hoffmann, Jan GÃ¶pfert, Tom Terlouw, Julian SchÃ¶nau, Patrick Kuckertz, Russell McKenna, Leander Kotzur, Jochen LinÃŸen, Detlef Stolten\nSummary: Recent global events emphasize the importance of a reliable energy supply.\nOne way to increase energy supply security is through decentralized off-grid\nrenewable energy systems, for which a growing number of case studies are\nresearched. This review gives a global overview of the levelized cost of\nelectricity (LCOE) for these autonomous energy systems, which range from 0.03\n\\$_{2021}/kWh to over 1.00 \\$_{2021}/kWh worldwide. The average LCOEs for 100%\nrenewable energy systems have decreased by 9% annually between 2016 and 2021\nfrom 0.54 \\$_{2021}/kWh to 0.29 \\$_{2021}/kWh, presumably due to cost\nreductions in renewable energy and storage technologies. Furthermore, we\nidentify and discuss seven key reasons why LCOEs are frequently overestimated\nor underestimated in literature, and how this can be prevented in the future.\nOur overview can be employed to verify findings on off-grid systems, to assess\nwhere these systems might be deployed and how costs evolve.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-13\nTitle: Multi-market Energy Optimization with Renewables via Reinforcement Learning\nAuthors: Lucien Werner, Peeyush Kumar\nSummary: This paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for\noptimizing the operations of power plants pairing renewable energy with\nstorage. The objective is to maximize revenue from energy markets while\nminimizing storage degradation costs and renewable curtailment. The framework\nhandles complexities such as time coupling by storage devices, uncertainty in\nrenewable generation and energy prices, and non-linear storage models. The\nstudy treats the problem as a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) and\nuses component-level simulators for storage. It utilizes RL to incorporate\ncomplex storage models, overcoming restrictions of optimization-based methods\nthat require convex and differentiable component models. A significant aspect\nof this approach is ensuring policy actions respect system constraints,\nachieved via a novel method of projecting potentially infeasible actions onto a\nsafe state-action set. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of this approach\nthrough extensive experiments using data from US and Indian electricity\nmarkets, comparing the learned RL policies with a baseline control poli; Answer: task complete.

Following an initial\nsystem dynamics workshop at the Data for Black Lives II conference hosted at\nMIT in January of 2019, a group of conference participants interested in\nbuilding capabilities to use system dynamics to understand complex societal\nissues convened monthly to explore issues related to racial bias in AI and\nimplications for health disparities through qualitative and simulation\nmodeling.

Collective\nmemory of community trauma, through deaths attributed to poor healthcare, and\nnegative experiences with healthcare are endogenous drivers of seeking\ntreatment and experiencing effective care, which impact the availability and\nquality of data for algorithms.

This paper\npresents a concise review of battery energy storage and an example of battery\nmodelling for renewable energy applications and second details an adaptive\napproach to solve this load levelling problem with storage. A dynamic\nevolutionary model based on the first kind Volterra integral equation is used\nin both cases. A direct regularised numerical method is employed to find the\nleast-cost dispatch of the battery in terms of integral equation solution.\nValidation on real data shows that the proposed evolutionary Volterra model\neffectively generalises conventional discrete integral model taking into\naccount both state of health and the availability of generation/storage.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece KayacÄ±k, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-04\nTitle: On the Stability of Strategic Energy Storage Operation in Wholesale Electricity Markets (Extended Version)\nAuthors: Aviad Navon, Juri Belikov, Ariel Orda, Yoash Levron\nSummary: High shares of variable renewable energy necessitate substantial energy\nstorage capacity. However, it remains unclear how to design a market that, on\nthe one hand, ensures a stable and sufficient income for storage firms, and, on\nthe other hand, maintains stable and affordable electricity costs for the\nconsumers. Here, we use a game theoretic model to study storage competition in\nwholesale electricity markets. A main result is that these types of games are\nnot necessarily stable. In particular, we find that under certain conditions,\nwhich imply a combination of a high share of variable renewable energy sources\nand low flexibility of conventional power plants, the system will not converge\nto an equilibrium. However, we demonstrate that a price cap on storage price\nbids can ensure convergence to a stable solution. Moreover, we find that when\nthe flexibility of conventional power plants is low, while the storage usage\nfor energy balancing increases with rene; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be d; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

The lockdown measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus have resulted in widespread job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a decline in global trade. According to research papers on arXiv, small businesses in the US were particularly hard hit by the lockdowns, with many experiencing significant declines in sales and revenue.\n\nMonetary policy played a crucial role in mitigating the economic consequences of COVID-19, according to another study. The use of monetary policies such as quantitative easing helped to stabilize financial markets and support economic activity.\n\nThe pandemic also had a significant impact on global trade and supply chains. Lockdowns and social distancing measures disrupted global supply chains, leading to delays and cancellations in the delivery of goods.\n\nIn terms of household impacts, lockdowns resulted in significant declines in employment, income, and consumption. However, research suggests that some households were able to mitigate these impacts through government support programs and other means.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on this analysis, it is clear that COVID-19 has had far-reaching economic consequences worldwide. Policymakers and business leaders must take steps to address the ongoing impacts of the pandemic and work towards rebuilding and recovering from its effects.\n\nThis summary will be used as a guide for future decision-making and policy development in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.'}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Further, interpretable machine learning\nmodels allow healthcare experts to make reasonable and data-driven decisions to\nprovide personalized decisions that can ultimately lead to higher quality of\nservice in healthcare. Generally, we can classify interpretability approaches\nin two groups where the first focuses on personalized interpretation (local\ninterpretability) while the second summarizes prediction models on a population\nlevel (global interpretability). Alternatively, we can group interpretability\nmethods into model-specific techniques, which are designed to interpret\npredictions generated by a specific model, such as a neural network, and\nmodel-agnostic approaches, which provide easy-to-understand explanations of\npredictions made by any machine learning model. Here, we give an overview of\ninterpretability approaches and provide examples of practical interpretability\nof machine learning in different areas of healthcare, including prediction of\nhealth-related outcomes, optimizing treatments or improving the efficiency of\nscreening for specific conditions. Further, we outline future directions for\ninterpretable machine learning and highlight the importance of developing\nalgorithmic solutions that can enable machine-learning driven decision making\nin high-stakes healthcare problems.\n\nPublished: 2023-11-29\nTitle: Interpreting Differentiable Latent States for Healthcare Time-series Data\nAuthors: Yu Chen, Nivedita Bijlani, Samaneh Kouchaki, Payam Barnaghi\nSummary: Machine learning enables extracting clinical insights from large temporal\ndatasets. The applications of such machine learning models include identifying\ndisease patterns and predicting patient outcomes. However, limited\ninterpretability poses challenges for deploying advanced machine learning in\ndigital healthcare. Understanding the meaning of latent states is crucial for\ninterpreting machine learning models, assuming they capture underlying\npatterns. In this paper, we present a concise algorithm that allows for i)\ninterpreting latent states using highly related input features; ii)\ninterpreting predictions using subsets of input features via latent states; and\niii) interpreting changes in latent states over time. The proposed algorithm is\nfeasible for any model that is differentiable. We demonstrate that this\napproach enables the identification of a daytime behavioral pattern for\npredicting nocturnal behavior in a real-world healthcare dataset.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-01\nTitle: Review of deep learning in healthcare\nAuthors: Hasan Hejbari Zargar, Saha Hejbari Zargar, Raziye Mehri\nSummary: Given the growing complexity of healthcare data over the last several years,\nusing machine learning techniques like Deep Neural Network (DNN) models has\ngained increased appeal. In order to extract hidden patterns and other valuable\ninformation from the huge quantity of health data, which traditional analytics\nare unable to do in a reasonable length of time, machine learning (ML)\ntechniques are used. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms in particular have been\nshown as potential approaches to pattern identification in healthcare systems.\nThis thought has led to the contribution of this research, which examines deep\nlearning methods used in healthcare systems via an examination of cutting-edge\nnetwork designs, applications, and market trends. To connect deep learning\nmethodologies and human healthcare interpretability, the initial objective is\nto provide in-depth insight into the deployment of deep learning models in\nhealthcare solutions.

Alternatively, we can group interpretability\nmethods into model-specific techniques, which are designed to interpret\npredictions generated by a specific model, such as a neural network, and\nmodel-agnostic approaches, which provide easy-to-understand explanations of\npredictions made by any machine learning model. Here, we give an overview of\ninterpretability approaches and provide examples of practical interpretability\nof machine learning in different areas of healthcare, including prediction of\nhealth-related outcomes, optimizing treatments or improving the efficiency of\nscreening for specific conditions. Further, we outline future directions for\ninterpretable machine learning and highlight the importance of developing\nalgorithmic solutions that can enable machine-learning driven decision making\nin high-stakes healthcare problems.\n\nPublished: 2023-11-29\nTitle: Interpreting Differentiable Latent States for Healthcare Time-series Data\nAuthors: Yu Chen, Nivedita Bijlani, Samaneh Kouchaki, Payam Barnaghi\nSummary: Machine learning enables extracting clinical insights from large temporal\ndatasets. The applications of such machine learning models include identifying\ndisease patterns and predicting patient outcomes. However, limited\ninterpretability poses challenges for deploying advanced machine learning in\ndigital healthcare. Understanding the meaning of latent states is crucial for\ninterpreting machine learning models, assuming they capture underlying\npatterns. In this paper, we present a concise algorithm that allows for i)\ninterpreting latent states using highly related input features; ii)\ninterpreting predictions using subsets of input features via latent states; and\niii) interpreting changes in latent states over time. The proposed algorithm is\nfeasible for any model that is differentiable. We demonstrate that this\napproach enables the identification of a daytime behavioral pattern for\npredicting nocturnal behavior in a real-world healthcare dataset.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-01\nTitle: Review of deep learning in healthcare\nAuthors: Hasan Hejbari Zargar, Saha Hejbari Zargar, Raziye Mehri\nSummary: Given the growing complexity of healthcare data over the last several years,\nusing machine learning techniques like Deep Neural Network (DNN) models has\ngained increased appeal. In order to extract hidden patterns and other valuable\ninformation from the huge quantity of health data, which traditional analytics\nare unable to do in a reasonable length of time, machine learning (ML)\ntechniques are used. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms in particular have been\nshown as potential approaches to pattern identification in healthcare systems.\nThis thought has led to the contribution of this research, which examines deep\nlearning methods used in healthcare systems via an examination of cutting-edge\nnetwork designs, applications, and market trends. To connect deep learning\nmethodologies and human healthcare interpretability, the initial objective is\nto provide in-depth insight into the deployment of deep learning models in\nhealthcare solutions.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

However,\nthe macro-energy system assessment of energy storage has often focused on\nisolated storage technologies and neglected competition between them, thus\nleaving out which energy storage to prioritise. The article applies a\nsystematic deployment analysis method that enables system-value evaluation in\nperfect competitive markets and demonstrates its application to 20 different\nenergy storage technologies across 40 distinct scenarios for a representative\nfuture power system in Africa. Here, each storage solution is explored alone\nand in competition with others, examining specific total system costs,\ndeployment configuration, and cost synergies between the storage technologies.\nThe results demonstrate the significant benefits of optimizing energy storage\nwith competition compared to without (+10% cost savings), and highlight the\nrelevance of several energy storage technologies in different scenarios. This\nwork provides insights into the role of energy storage in decarbonizing power\nsystems and informs future research and policy decisions. There is no\none-size-fits-all energy storage, but rather an ideal combination of multiple\nenergy storage options designed and operated in symbiosis.\n\nPublished: 2018-09-28\nTitle: On the Marginal Value of Electricity Storage\nAuthors: Eilyan Bitar, Pramod Khargonekar, Kameshwar Poolla\nSummary: We investigate the problem of characterizing the economic value of energy\nstorage capacity to a wind power producer (WPP) that sells its energy in a\nconventional two-settlement electricity market. The WPP can offer a forward\ncontract to supply power in the day-ahead market, subject to financial\npenalties for imbalances between the contracted power and the power that is\ndelivered in real-time. We consider the setting in which the WPP has access to\na co-located energy storage system, and can thus reshape its wind power\nproduction subject to its storage capacity constraints. Modeling wind power as\na random process, we show that the problem of determining optimal forward\ncontract offerings--given recourse with storage--is convex. We further\nestablish that the maximum expected profit is concave and non-decreasing in the\nenergy storage capacity, which reveals that the greatest marginal benefit from\nenergy storage is derived from initial investment in small storage capacity. We\nprovide a characterization of the marginal value of small energy storage\ncapacity to the WPP. The formulae we derive shed light on the relationship\nbetween the value of storage and certain statistical measures of variability in\nthe underlying wind power process.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-17\nTitle: Mobile Energy Storage in Power Network: Marginal Value and Optimal Operation\nAuthors: Utkarsha Agwan, Junjie Qin, Kameshwar Poolla, Pravin Varaiya\nSummary: This paper examines the marginal value of mobile energy storage, i.e., energy\nstorage units that can be efficiently relocated to other locations in the power\nnetwork. In particular, we formulate and analyze the joint problem for\noperating the power grid and a fleet of mobile storage units. We use two\ndifferent storage models: rapid storage, which disregards travel time and power\nconstraints, and general storage, which incorporates them. By explicitly\nconnecting the marginal value of mobile storage to locational marginal prices\n(LMPs), we propose efficient algorithms that only use LMPs and transportation\ncosts to optimize the relocation trajectories of the mobile storage units.\nFurthermore, we provide examples and conditions under which the marginal value\nof mobile storage is strictly higher, equal to, or strictly lower than the sum\nof marginal value of corresponding stationary storage units ; Answer: task complete.

Patil, Uday P. Khedkar, Priyanka K. Pawar\nSummary: Energy storage technologies play a crucial role in integrating renewable energy sources into the power grid, enabling better utilization of intermittent resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Among various energy storage options, batteries (lithium-ion, lead-acid, flow batteries), hydrogen fuel cells, and pumped hydro storage are some of the prominent ones. This study aims to compare the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of these three technologies. A comprehensive review of existing literature on each technology is presented, followed by a comparison based on several key performance indicators such as capacity factor, round-trip efficiency, self-discharge rate, lifespan, environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness. The results show that lithium-ion batteries have higher capacity factors (40-60%) compared to lead-acid batteries (20-30%), but are more expensive than both. Hydrogen fuel cells exhibit better energy density and longer lifespans than other two options, but face challenges related to hydrogen production, storage, and transportation costs. Pumped hydro storage technology is cost-effective and offers a high capacity factor (60-70%), however, it requires suitable topography for its implementation. This comparative study can serve as a valuable reference for policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders to make informed decisions about energy storage technologies for renewable power systems.\n\nPublished: 2022-02-25\nTitle: A Review of Energy Storage Technologies for Power Grids: Trends and Challenges\nAuthors: Sreekanth R.

Comprehensive climate models\nhave struggled to reproduce this, typically simulating a slower rate of sea ice\nretreat than has been observed. However, this bias has been widely noted to\nhave decreased in models participating in the most recent phase of the Coupled\nModel Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) compared with the previous generation of\nmodels (CMIP3). Here we examine simulations from both CMIP3 and CMIP5. We find\nthat simulated historical sea ice trends are influenced by volcanic forcing,\nwhich was included in all of the CMIP5 models but in only about half of the\nCMIP3 models. The volcanic forcing causes temporary simulated cooling in the\n1980s and 1990s, which contributes to raising the simulated 1979-2013\nglobal-mean surface temperature trends to values substantially larger than\nobserved. We show that this warming bias is accompanied by an enhanced rate of\nArctic sea ice retreat and hence a simulated sea ice trend that is closer to\nthe observed value, which is consistent with previous findings of an\napproximately linear relationship between sea ice extent and global-mean\nsurface temperature. We find that both generations of climate models simulate\nArctic sea ice that is substantially less sensitive to global warming than has\nbeen observed. The results imply that the much of the difference in Arctic sea\nice trends between CMIP3 and CMIP5 occurred due to the inclusion of volcanic\nforcing, rather than improved sea ice physics or model resolution.\n\nPublished: 2023-05-09\nTitle: Impact of Changing Greenhouse Gas Concentrations on Ontario\'s Climate\nAuthors: W. A. van Wijngaarden\nSummary: The effect of changing greenhouse gas concentrations on climate was examined.\nCalculations of the climate sensitivity, the warming of the Earth due to a\ndoubling of atmospheric CO2, are discussed. Ontario was responsible for 0.35%\nof the world\'s CO2 emissions in 2019 and this amount was 20% lower than in\n2005. The predictions of Global Climate Models (GCM) were compared to\nobservations. Records since 1880 show an overall warming of about 1 C. The GCMs\ndo not account for observed decadal temperature fluctuations and consistently\noverestimate the warming. Ontario\'s contribution to global warming is only 9.2\nx 10^{-5} C/year using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nrecommended climate sensitivity value. Measurements of the polar ice caps\nreveal a decrease in the minimum September Arctic sea ice extent during\n1979-2022 but the trend levelled off after 2007; while the average Antarctic\nsea ice extent slightly increased. Sea level increased slightly throughout the\n20th century. Ontario\'s contribution to anthropogenic sea level rise is about\n0.005 mm/year. Sea level along Ontario\'s Hudson Bay coast is decreasing due to\nisostatic rebound of the land following the last Ice Age. The change to ocean\nacidity due to CO2 absorption from the atmosphere is negligible compared to\nthat due to tides, ocean depth and seasonal effects. Ontario\'s contribution to\nocean acidification is estimated to be 6 x 10^{-6} pH/year. No changes in\nprecipitation in North America over the 19th and 20th centuries, nor at Toronto\nsince 1843, were found. The Great Lake levels are remarkably constant over the\npast century showing no evidence of a change in the incidence of flooding. No\nevidence was found that the frequency of extreme events such as hurricanes or\ntornadoes increased during recent decades. The number of forest fires in Canada\nand Ontario decreased during 1990 to 2020.\n\nPublished: 2020-09-07\nTitle: Sea ice and methane\nAuthors: Clive Hambler, Peter A.

Here, HESS is a combination of lithium\nbattery and supercapacitor; this combination has been proven to effectively\ncompensate for some of the deficiencies of lithium batteries as an energy\nsystem for electric vehicles. For example, the energy storage system with only\nlithium batteries cannot provide high power in a short time to meet the high\nacceleration performance of electric vehicles, and the excessive discharge\ncurrent will cause the temperature of the battery pack to be too high, which\nwill cause safety problems for the car. This paper proposes an intelligent\nenergy management strategy combining fuzzy controller and improved\nSavitzky-Golay filter for real-time control. The simulation results show that\ncompared with single ESS, the maximum current of the battery proposed by the\nstrategy is reduced by 14.60%, and the usable cycle life of the battery is\nincreased by 57.31% during the test driving cycle. Meanwhile, it explores\nvarious changes brought supercapacitor monomers in the same HESS, and predict\nthe next supercapacitor will bring about 31.58% reduction of volume and mass.\n\nPublished: 2019-08-27\nTitle: A Systematic Study to Improve the Performance of SrCoO3 as anAnion-Intercalation-Type Electrode for Supercapacitors Through Interface, Oxygen Vacancies, and Doping\nAuthors: Sadhana Lolla, Xuan Luo\nSummary: Supercapacitors have recently gained popularity as possible energy storage\nsystems due to their high cycling ability and increased power density. However,\none of the major drawbacks of supercapacitors is that they have a low energy\ndensity, which makes them less effective than batteries. Herein, we explore\ndifferent methods of increasing the supercapacitor performance of the\nperovskite SrCoO3. We carry out first-principles calculations to systematically\nstudy how SrCoO3/graphene interface, oxygen vacancies, and doping improve the\nperformance of strontium cobaltite as an anion-intercalation-type\nsupercapacitor. The results show that the SrCoO3/graphene interface is\nrelatively stable with a formation energy of 1.3 eV and is highly conductive,\nwhich makes it a promising material for supercapacitors. We also find that\ninducing oxygen vacancies in SrCoO3 significantly increases the conductivity of\nthis material. Results of doping calculations reveal that doping with Mo, V, P,\nand Nb all increase the stability and conductivity of SrCoO3. We find that\nniobium is the most stable and most conductive of all four dopants. In\naddition, we find that vanadium is a very promising novel dopant for SrCoO3 as\nan anion-intercalation-type supercapacitor electrode material.\n\nPublished: 2020-09-11\nTitle: Optimal Power Allocation in Battery/Supercapacitor Electric Vehicles using Convex Optimization\nAuthors: Sebastian East, Mark Cannon\nSummary: This paper presents a framework for optimizing the power allocation between a\nbattery and supercapacitor in an electric vehicle energy storage system. A\nconvex optimal control formulation is proposed that minimizes total energy\nconsumption whilst enforcing hard constraints on power output and total energy\nstored in the battery and supercapacitor. An alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed, for which the computational and\nmemory requirements scale linearly with the length of the prediction horizon\n(and can be reduced using parallel processing). The optimal controller is\ncompared with a low-pass filter against an all-battery baseline in numerical\nsimulations, where it is shown to provide significant improvement in battery\ndegradation (inferred through reductions of 71.4% in peak battery power, 21.0%\nin root-mean-squared battery power, and 13.7% in battery throughput), and a\nreduction of ; Answer: task complete.

The economic benefits and power\ngrid reliability are both essential for hydrogen storage integration. In this\npaper, an annual scheduling model (ASM) for energy hubs (EH) coupled power\ngrids is proposed to investigate the annual benefits of seasonal hydrogen\nstorage (SHS). Each energy hub consists of hydrogen storage, electrolyzers, and\nfuel cells. The electrical and hydrogen energy can be exchanged on the bus with\nthe energy hub. The physical constraints for both grids and EHs are enforced in\nASM. The proposed ASM considers the intra-season daily operation of the EH\ncoupled grids. Four typical daily profiles are used in ASM to represent the\ngrid conditions in four seasons, which reduces the computational burden.\nBesides, both the intra-season and cross-season hydrogen exchange and storage\nare modeled in the ASM. Hence, the utilization of hydrogen storage is optimized\non a year-round level. Numerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 24-bus\nsystem. The simulation results indicate that seasonal hydrogen storage can\neffectively save the annual operation cost and reduce renewable curtailments.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-02\nTitle: Hydrogen and Battery Based Energy Storage System (ESS) for Future DC Microgrids\nAuthors: Massiagbe Diabate, Timothy Vriend, Harish S Krishnamoorthy, Jian Shi\nSummary: In this paper, a hydrogen-based energy storage system (ESS) is proposed for\nDC microgrids, which can potentially be integrated with battery ESS to meet the\nneeds of future grids with high renewable penetration. Hydrogen-based ESS can\nprovide a stable energy supply for a long time but has a slower response than\nbattery ESSs. However, a combination of battery and hydrogen storage provides\nstable energy for an extended period of time and can easily handle the sudden\ndemands and surpluses of the microgrid. One of the main challenges in this\nsystem is the integration of power electronics with fuel cell technology to\nconvert renewable energy into electricity seamlessly. This paper proposes a\nsystem that uses an isolated DC-DC converter to activate clean hydrogen\nproduction using an electrolyzer and then pressurize the hydrogen to store in a\ntank. The pressured hydrogen becomes an essential input to the fuel cell, which\nregulates and transforms it into electricity. The electricity produced is then\ntransferred to the grid using a DC-DC boost converter. A Simulink model of the\nhybrid system with a 1 kV DC bus voltage is used to demonstrate the hydrogen\nproduction and fuel cell behavior based on the demand and surplus power of the\nloads. The proposed system simulates aspects of the power conversion,\nelectrolyzer, storage tank, and fuel cell needed for the proposed hybrid ESS.\nDue to its economic feasibility, the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) is the\nprimary technology considered for the electrolyzer and fuel cell.\n\nPublished: 2023-12-17\nTitle: Power and Hydrogen Hybrid Transmission for Renewable Energy Systems: An Integrated Expansion Planning Strategy\nAuthors: Jin Lu, Xingpeng Li\nSummary: The increasing interest in hydrogen as a clean energy source has led to\nextensive research into its transmission, storage, and integration with bulk\npower systems. With the evolution of hydrogen technologies towards greater\nefficiency, and cost-effectiveness, it becomes essential to examine the\noperation and expansion of grids that include both electric power and hydrogen\nfacilities.

A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-05-06\nTitle: Impact of digital economic activity on regional economic growth: A Case study from northern Minas Gerais between 2009 To 2018\nAuthors: Dr. Cesar R Salas-Guerra\nSummary: At present, the economic measurement of the national statistical offices has\nnot defined or captured the benefits of the digital economy activity due to the\nlow quality or inexistence of methodologies. Currently, there is a relevant\ndebate on the capacity of the digital economy activity to generate\nproductivity, economic growth, and well-being through innovation and knowledge.\nFor this reason, this research identified and studied specialized knowledge,\nhuman settlement, and digital economic activity as the factors that influence\nregional economic growth. As a result, the impact generated by a new business\noperating models based on information technology was measured. Furthermore,\nthis research used an empirical measurement model that made it possible to\nidentify certain phenomena such as regional poles of regional economic\ndevelopment (PRDE) that surround economically flourishing regions. In addition,\nit showed that municipalities with high degrees of economic growth were\nimpacted by digital economic activity and specialized knowledge. This finding\nis consistent with economic growth theories that point to technological\nevolution as the main factor of modern economic growth.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2024-04-04\nTitle: Enabling Clean Energy Resilience with Machine Learning-Empowered Underground Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Alvaro Carbonero, Shaowen Mao, Mohamed Mehana\nSummary: To address the urgent challenge of climate change, there is a critical need\nto transition away from fossil fuels towards sustainable energy systems, with\nrenewable energy sources playing a pivotal role. However, the inherent\nvariability of renewable energy, without effective storage solutions, often\nleads to imbalances between energy supply and demand. Underground Hydrogen\nStorage (UHS) emerges as a promising long-term storage solution to bridge this\ngap, yet its widespread implementation is impeded by the high computational\ncosts associated with high fidelity UHS simulations. This paper introduces UHS\nfrom a data-driven perspective and outlines a roadmap for integrating machine\nlearning into UHS, thereby facilitating the large-scale deployment of UHS.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.
