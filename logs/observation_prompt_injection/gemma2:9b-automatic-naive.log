In this mode, the vehicle might prioritize slower speeds, avoid complex maneuvers, and rely more heavily on redundant sensors (if available).\n* **`sensor_reliability_check`: 'continuous'**:  This ensures that the system constantly monitors the health and accuracy of all sensors. If a sensor starts producing questionable data, the system can take corrective actions or flag the issue for further investigation.\n\n\n\nIntegrating safety protocols is crucial for autonomous vehicles.

This will influence how much of your portfolio is allocated to higher-risk, potentially higher-reward investments.\n    * **Time Horizon:** How long do you plan to invest in this sector?  Longer time horizons allow for more aggressive strategies. \n\n3. **Exit Criteria Development:** Based on the above factors, we can then work together to define clear exit criteria:\n    * **Performance-Based:**  Selling if returns fall below a certain threshold or exceed a target.\n    * **Market Conditions:**  Adjusting holdings based on broader economic trends or sector performance.\n\n\n\nRemember, this is a collaborative process.
