Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be d; Answer: task complete.

They will\nlikely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,\ncomputation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally\nstochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum\ncomputation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum\nalgorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo\ntechniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum\ncomputation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to\nrevolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be\ngenerated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine\nrandom numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up\nmedian evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This\npaper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and\nquantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and\nquantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much\nfaster than the available classic algorithms.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities.

We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum\ncomputation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to\nrevolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be\ngenerated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine\nrandom numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up\nmedian evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This\npaper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and\nquantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and\nquantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much\nfaster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical\nframework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Using quantum error correction, Bravyi, Gosset,\nK\\"onig and Tomamichel (Nature Physics 2020) further proved that a similar\nseparation still persists even if quantum circuits are subject to local\nstochastic noise.\n  In this paper, we consider the case where any constant fraction of the qubits\n(for instance, huge blocks of qubits) may be arbitrarily corrupted at the end\nof the computation. We make a first step forward towards establishing a quantum\nadvantage even in this extremely challenging setting: we show that there exists\na computational problem that can be solved in constant depth by a quantum\ncircuit but such that even solving any large subproblem of this problem\nrequires logarithmic depth with bounded fan-in classical circuits. This gives\nanother compelling evidence of the computational power of quantum shallow\ncircuits.\n  In order to show our result, we consider the Graph State Sampling problem\n(which was also used in prior works) on expander graphs. We exploit the\n"robustness" of expander graphs against vertex corruption to show that a\nsubproblem hard for small-depth classical circuits can still be extracted from\nthe output of the corrupted quantum circuit.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-26\nTitle: The Argument against Quantum Computers, the Quantum Laws of Nature, and Google\'s Supremacy Claims\nAuthors: Gil Kalai\nSummary: My 2018 lecture at the ICA workshop in Singapore dealt with quantum\ncomputation as a meeting point of the laws of computation and the laws of\nquantum mechanics. We described a computational complexity argument against the\nfeasibility of quantum computers: we identified a very low-level complexity\nclass of probability distributions described by noisy intermediate-scale\nquantum computers, and explained why it would allow neither good-quality\nquantum error-correction nor a demonstration of "quantum supremacy," namely,\nthe ability of quantum computers to make computations that are impossible or\nextremely hard for classical computers. We went on to describe general\npredictions arising from the argument and proposed general laws that manifest\nthe failure of quantum computers.\n  In October 2019, "Nature" published a paper describing an experimental work\nthat took place at Google. The paper claims to demonstrate quantum\n(computational) supremacy on a 53-qubit quantum computer, thus clearly\nchallenging my theory.

In the process, information is lost.\nMeasurement along which set of projectors would accompany minimum loss in\ninformation content is the optimization problem of quantum discord and is an\nimportant aspect of a classical to quantum transition because it asks us to\nlook for the most classical states. This optimization problem is known to be\nNP-complete and is important because discord is defined through it making it a\nmajor obstacle on every computation. The standard zero discord condition helps\nus move to a stronger measure that addresses the correlated observables, in\nsuch a context we show that discord minimizes at the diagonal basis of the\nreduced density matrices and present an analytical expression of the measure.; Answer: task complete.

Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society.

In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility.

Kuhlberg, Irene Headen, Ellis A. Ballard, Donald Martin Jr.\nSummary: Much attention and concern has been raised recently about bias and the use of\nmachine learning algorithms in healthcare, especially as it relates to\nperpetuating racial discrimination and health disparities. Following an initial\nsystem dynamics workshop at the Data for Black Lives II conference hosted at\nMIT in January of 2019, a group of conference participants interested in\nbuilding capabilities to use system dynamics to understand complex societal\nissues convened monthly to explore issues related to racial bias in AI and\nimplications for health disparities through qualitative and simulation\nmodeling. In this paper we present results and insights from the modeling\nprocess and highlight the importance of centering the discussion of data and\nhealthcare on people and their experiences with healthcare and science, and\nrecognizing the societal context where the algorithm is operating. Collective\nmemory of community trauma, through deaths attributed to poor healthcare, and\nnegative experiences with healthcare are endogenous drivers of seeking\ntreatment and experiencing effective care, which impact the availability and\nquality of data for algorithms. These drivers have drastically disparate\ninitial conditions for different racial groups and point to limited impact of\nfocusing solely on improving diagnostic algorithms for achieving better health\noutcomes for some groups.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developin; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).

Following an initial\nsystem dynamics workshop at the Data for Black Lives II conference hosted at\nMIT in January of 2019, a group of conference participants interested in\nbuilding capabilities to use system dynamics to understand complex societal\nissues convened monthly to explore issues related to racial bias in AI and\nimplications for health disparities through qualitative and simulation\nmodeling. In this paper we present results and insights from the modeling\nprocess and highlight the importance of centering the discussion of data and\nhealthcare on people and their experiences with healthcare and science, and\nrecognizing the societal context where the algorithm is operating. Collective\nmemory of community trauma, through deaths attributed to poor healthcare, and\nnegative experiences with healthcare are endogenous drivers of seeking\ntreatment and experiencing effective care, which impact the availability and\nquality of data for algorithms. These drivers have drastically disparate\ninitial conditions for different racial groups and point to limited impact of\nfocusing solely on improving diagnostic algorithms for achieving better health\noutcomes for some groups.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

Recently, machine learning approaches have\nshown improvement over conventional modeling techniques by better capturing\ncomplex interactions between patient covariates in a data-driven manner.\nHowever, the use of machine learning introduces a number of technical and\npractical challenges that have thus far restricted widespread adoption of such\ntechniques in clinical settings. To address these challenges and empower\nhealthcare professionals, we present a machine learning framework,\nAutoPrognosis 2.0, to develop diagnostic and prognostic models. AutoPrognosis\nleverages state-of-the-art advances in automated machine learning to develop\noptimized machine learning pipelines, incorporates model explainability tools,\nand enables deployment of clinical demonstrators, without requiring significant\ntechnical expertise. Our framework eliminates the major technical obstacles to\npredictive modeling with machine learning that currently impede clinical\nadoption.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be d; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

They will\nlikely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,\ncomputation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally\nstochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum\ncomputation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum\nalgorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo\ntechniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum\ncomputation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to\nrevolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be\ngenerated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine\nrandom numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up\nmedian evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This\npaper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and\nquantum information.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms.

Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum circuit model.

They will\nlikely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,\ncomputation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally\nstochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum\ncomputation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum\nalgorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo\ntechniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum\ncomputation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to\nrevolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be\ngenerated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine\nrandom numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up\nmedian evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This\npaper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and\nquantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and\nquantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much\nfaster than the available classic algorithms.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events.

Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

In\nthis formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,\nwhile gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum\noperations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric\nway of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative\nproposal of building a quantum computer.\n\nPublished: 2012-10-02\nTitle: Quantum Computation and Quantum Information\nAuthors: Yazhen Wang\nSummary: Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in\ncomputer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will\nlikely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,\ncomputation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally\nstochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum\ncomputation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum\nalgorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo\ntechniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum\ncomputation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to\nrevolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be\ngenerated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine\nrandom numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up\nmedian evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This\npaper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and\nquantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and\nquantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much\nfaster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical\nframework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.; Answer: task complete.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices.

In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic.

Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

They will\nlikely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,\ncomputation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally\nstochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum\ncomputation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum\nalgorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo\ntechniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum\ncomputation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to\nrevolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be\ngenerated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine\nrandom numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up\nmedian evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This\npaper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and\nquantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and\nquantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much\nfaster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical\nframework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions.

Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-19\nTitle: Techno-economic analysis of renewable energy generation at the South Pole\nAuthors: Susan Babinec, Ian Baring-Gould, Amy N. Bender, Nate Blair, Xiangkun Li, Ralph T. Muehleisen, Dan Olis, Silvana Ovaitt\nSummary: Transitioning from fossil-fuel power generation to renewable energy\ngeneration and energy storage in remote locations has the potential to reduce\nboth carbon emissions and cost. This study presents a techno-economic analysis\nfor implementation of a hybrid renewable energy system at the South Pole in\nAntarctica, which currently hosts several high-energy physics experiments with\nnontrivial power needs. A tailored model of resource availability and economics\nfor solar photovoltaics, wind turbine generators, lithium-ion energy storage,\nand long-duration energy storage at this site is explored in different\ncombinations with and without existing diesel energy generation. The Renewable\nEnergy Integration and Optimization (REopt) platform is used to determine the\noptimal system component sizing and the associated system economics and\nenvironmental benefit. We find that the least-cost system includes all three\nenergy generation sources and lithium-ion energy storage. For an example\nsteady-state load of 170 kW, this hybrid system includes 180 kW-DC of\nphotovoltaic panels, 570 kW of wind turbines, and a 3.4 MWh lithium-ion battery\nenergy storage system. This system reduces diesel consumption by 95% compared\nto an all-diesel configuration, resulting in approximately 1200 metric tons of\ncarbon footprint avoided annually. Over the course of a 15-year analysis period\nthe reduced diesel usage leads to a net savings of 57 million United States\ndollars, with a time to payback of approximately two years. All the scenarios\nmodeled show that the transition to renewables is highly cost effective under\nthe unique economics and constraints of this extremely remote site.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE).

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be d; Answer: task complete.

The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing.

We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2018-07-04\nTitle: Climate network percolation reveals the expansion and weakening of the tropical component under global warming\nAuthors: Jingfang Fan, Jun Meng, Yosef Ashkenazy, Shlomo Havlin, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber\nSummary: Global climate warming poses a significant challenge to humanity; it is\nassociated with, e.g., rising sea level and declining Arctic sea ice.\nIncreasing extreme events are also considered to be a result of climate\nwarming~\\cite{pachauri2014climate,ogorman_contrasting_2014} and they may have\nwidespread and diverse effects on health, agriculture, economics and political\nconflicts\n\\cite{hsiang2011civil,helbing_globally_2013,schleussner_armed-conflict_2016,carleton_social_2016}.\nStill, the detection and quantification of climate change, both in observations\nand climate models, constitute a main focus of the scientific community. Here\nwe develop a new approach based on network and percolation frameworks\n\\cite{cohen2010complex} to study the impacts of climate changes in the past\ndecades using historical models and reanalysis records, and we analyze the\nexpected upcoming impacts using various future global warming scenarios. More\nspecifically, we classify the globe area into evolving percolation clusters and\nfind a discontinuous phase transition, which indicates a consistent poleward\nexpansion of the largest (tropical) cluster, as well as the weakening of the\nlink\'s strength. This is found both in the reanalysis data and in the Coupled\nModel Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) twenty-first century climate\nchange simulations~\\cite{taylor2012overview}. The analysis is based on high\nresolution surface (2~m) air temperature field records. We discuss the\nunderlying mechanism for the observed expansion of the tropical cluster and\nassociate it with changes in atmospheric circulation represented by the\nweakening and expansion of the Hadley cell. Our framework can also be useful\nfor forecasting the extent of the tropical cluster in order to detect its\ninfluence on different areas in response to global warming.\n\nPublished: 2022-08-15\nTitle: Latent trajectory models for spatio-temporal dynamics in Alaskan ecosystems\nAuthors: Xinyi Lu, Mevin B. Hooten, Ann M. Raiho, David K. Swanson, Carl A. Roland, Sarah E. Stehn\nSummary: The Alaskan landscape has undergone substantial changes in recent decades,\nmost notably the expansion of shrubs and trees across the Arctic. We developed\na dynamic statistical model to quantify the impact of climate change on the\nstructural transformation of ecosystems using remotely sensed imagery. We used\nlatent trajectory processes in a hierarchical framework to model dynamic state\nprobabilities that evolve annually, from which we derived transition\nprobabilities between ecotypes. Our latent trajectory model accommodates\ntemporal irregularity in survey intervals and uses spatio-temporally\nheterogeneous climate dr; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be d; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-05-10\nTitle: Two Burning Questions on COVID-19: Did shutting down the economy help? Can we (partially) reopen the economy without risking the second wave?\nAuthors: Anish Agarwal, Abdullah Alomar, Arnab Sarker, Devavrat Shah, Dennis Shen, Cindy Yang\nSummary: As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most pressing question\nfacing us is: can we even partially reopen the economy without risking a second\nwave? We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if\nit did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic\nwhile partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand\nthe effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their\ncorresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist,\nthe key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential\ntrade-offs between them, and choosing the partic; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2022-08-25\nTitle: The Sustainable Response Strategy to COVID-19: Pandemic Urban Zoning Based on Multimodal Transport Data\nAuthors: Yufei Wang, Mingzhuang Hua, Xuewu Chen, Wendong Chen, Long Cheng\nSummary: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, it has rapidly evolved into a sudden and\nmajor public health emergency globally. With the variants of COVID-19, the\ndifficulty of pandemic control continues to increase, which has brought\nsignificant costs to the society. The existing pandemic control zoning method\nignores the impact on residents\'lives. In this study, we propose a refined and\nlow-cost pandemic control method by scientifically delineating zoning areas.\nFirst, a spatial interaction network is built up based on the multimodal\ntransport travel data in Nanjing, China, and an improved Leiden community\ndetection method based on the gravity model is used to obtain a preliminary\nzoning scheme. Then, we use spatial constraints to correct the results with the\ndiscrete spatial distribution. Finally, reasonable zones for pandemic control\nare obtained. The modularity of the algorithm results is 0.4185, proving that\nthe proposed method is suitable for pandemic control zoning. The proposed\nmethod is also demonstrated to be able to minimize traffic flows between\npandemic control areas and only 24.8% of travel connections are cut off, thus\nreducing the impact of pandemic control on residents\'daily life and reducing\nt; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X.

Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather.

In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

It is\na waste of free and green renewable energy and implies current power grids are\nunable to accommodate more renewable sources. One major reason is that higher\npower transmission capacity is required for higher renewable penetration level.\nAnother major reason is the volatility of the renewable generation. The\nhydrogen mix or pure hydrogen pipeline can both transfer and store the energy\nin the form of hydrogen. However, its potential of accelerating renewable\nintegration has not been investigated. In this paper, hydrogen pipeline\nnetworks, combined with power-to-hydrogen (P2H) and hydrogen-to-power (H2P)\nfacilities, are organized to form a Hydrogen Energy Transmission and Conversion\nSystem (HETCS). We investigate the operation of power systems coupled with\nHETCS, and propose the day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC)\nwith HETCS. The SCUC simulation is conducted on a modified IEEE 24-bus power\nsystem with HETCS. Simulation results show HETCS can substantially reduce the\nrenewable curtailment, CO2 emission, load payment and total operational cost.\nThis study validates the HETCS can be a promising solution to achieve net-zero\nrenewable grids.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece KayacÄ±k, Albert H.

Taylor, Johanna L. Mathieu, Duncan S. Callaway, Kameshwar Poolla\nSummary: Energy storage can absorb variability from the rising number of wind and\nsolar power producers. Storage is different from the conventional generators\nthat have traditionally balanced supply and demand on fast time scales due to\nits hard energy capacity constraints, dynamic coupling, and low marginal costs.\nThese differences are leading system operators to propose new mechanisms for\nenabling storage to participate in reserve and real-time energy markets. The\npersistence of market power and gaming in electricity markets suggests that\nthese changes will expose new vulnerabilities.\n  We develop a new model of strategic behavior among storages in energy\nbalancing markets. Our model is a two-stage game that generalizes a classic\nmodel of capacity followed by Bertrand-Edgeworth price competition by\nexplicitly modeling storage dynamics and uncertainty in the pricing stage. By\napplying the model to balancing markets with storage, we are able to compare\ncapacity and energy-based pricing schemes, and to analyze the dynamic effects\nof the market horizon and energy losses due to leakage. Our first key finding\nis that capacity pricing leads to higher prices and higher capacity\ncommitments, and that energy pricing leads to lower, randomized prices and\nlower capacity commitments. Second, we find that a longer market horizon and\nhigher physical efficiencies lead to lower prices by inducing the storage to\ncompete to have their states of charge cycled more frequently.\n\nPublished: 2021-06-21\nTitle: How well do you know your summarization datasets?\nAuthors: Priyam Tejaswin, Dhruv Naik, Pengfei Liu\nSummary: State-of-the-art summarization systems are trained and evaluated on massive\ndatasets scraped from the web. Despite their prevalence, we know very little\nabout the underlying characteristics (data noise, summarization complexity,\netc.) of these datasets, and how these affect system performance and the\nreliability of automatic metrics like ROUGE. In this study, we manually analyze\n600 samples from three popular summarization datasets. Our study is driven by a\nsix-class typology which captures different noise types (missing facts,\nentities) and degrees of summarization difficulty (extractive, abstractive). We\nfollow with a thorough analysis of 27 state-of-the-art summarization models and\n5 popular metrics, and report our key insights: (1) Datasets have distinct data\nquality and complexity distributions, which can be traced back to their\ncollection process. (2) The performance of models and reliability of metrics is\ndependent on sample complexity. (3) Faithful summaries often receive low scores\nbecause of the poor diversity of references. We release the code, annotated\ndata and model outputs.\n\nPublished: 2020-04-28\nTitle: A Perspective on High-performance CNT fibres for Structural Composites\nAuthors: A. Mikhalchan, J. J. Vilatela\nSummary: This review summarizes progress on structural composites with carbon nanotube\nfibres. It starts by analyzing their development towards a macroscopic ensemble\nof elongated and aligned crystalline domains, alongside the evolution of the\nstructure of traditional high-performance fibres. Literature on tensile\nproperties suggests that there are two emerging grades: highly aligned fibres\nspun from liquid crystalline solutions, with high modulus and strength, and\nspun from aerogels of ultra long-nanotubes, combining high strength and\nfracture energy. The fabrication of large unidirectional fabrics with similar\nproperties as the fibres is presently a challenge, which CNT alignment\nremaining a key factor. A promising approach is to produce fabrics directly\nfrom aerogel filaments without having to densify and handle individual CNT\nfibres.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

This challenging nature of literature\nreview writing makes automatic related work generation (RWG) academically and\ncomputationally interesting, and also makes it an excellent test bed for\nexamining the capability of SOTA natural language processing (NLP) models.\nSince the initial proposal of the RWG task, its popularity has waxed and waned,\nfollowing the capabilities of mainstream NLP approaches.

Existing MDS datasets usually focus on\nproducing the structureless summary covering a few input documents. Meanwhile,\nprevious structured summary generation works focus on summarizing a single\ndocument into a multi-section summary. These existing datasets and methods\ncannot meet the requirements of summarizing numerous academic papers into a\nstructured summary. To deal with the scarcity of available data, we propose\nBigSurvey, the first large-scale dataset for generating comprehensive summaries\nof numerous academic papers on each topic. We collect target summaries from\nmore than seven thousand survey papers and utilize their 430 thousand reference\npapers\' abstracts as input documents. To organize the diverse content from\ndozens of input documents and ensure the efficiency of processing long text\nsequences, we propose a summarization method named category-based alignment and\nsparse transformer (CAST). The experimental results show that our CAST method\noutperforms various advanced summarization methods.\n\nPublished: 2020-11-03\nTitle: Topic-Centric Unsupervised Multi-Document Summarization of Scientific and News Articles\nAuthors: Amanuel Alambo, Cori Lohstroh, Erik Madaus, Swati Padhee, Brandy Foster, Tanvi Banerjee, Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan, Michael Raymer\nSummary: Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled automation of a\nwide range of tasks, including machine translation, named entity recognition,\nand sentiment analysis. Automated summarization of documents, or groups of\ndocuments, however, has remained elusive, with many efforts limited to\nextraction of keywords, key phrases, or key sentences. Accurate abstractive\nsummarization has yet to be achieved due to the inherent difficulty of the\nproblem, and limited availability of training data. In this paper, we propose a\ntopic-centric unsupervised multi-document summarization framework to generate\nextractive and abstractive summaries for groups of scientific articles across\n20 Fields of Study (FoS) in Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and news articles\nfrom DUC-2004 Task 2. The proposed algorithm generates an abstractive summary\nby developing salient language unit selection and text generation techniques.\nOur approach matches the state-of-the-art when evaluated on automated\nextractive evaluation metrics and performs better for abstractive summarization\non five human evaluation metrics (entailment, coherence, conciseness,\nreadability, and grammar). We achieve a kappa score of 0.68 between two\nco-author linguists who evaluated our results. We plan to publicly share\nMAG-20, a human-validated gold standard dataset of topic-clustered research\narticles and their summaries to promote research in abstractive summarization.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-16\nTitle: A Bayesian Approach for Inferring Sea Ice Loads\nAuthors: Matthew Parno, Taylor Hodgdon, Brendan West, Devin O\'Connor, Arnold Song\nSummary: The Earth\'s climate is rapidly changing and some of the most drastic changes\ncan be seen in the Arctic, where sea ice extent has diminished considerably in\nrecent years. As the Arctic climate continues to change, gathering in situ sea\nice measurements is increasingly important for understanding the complex\nevolution of the Arctic ice pack. To date, observations of ice stresses in the\nArctic have been spatially and temporally sparse. We propose a measurement\nframework that would instrument existing sea ice buoys with strain gauges. This\nmeasurement framework uses a Bayesian inference approach to infer ice loads\nacting on the buoy from a set of strain gauge measurements. To test our\nframework, strain measurements were collected from an experiment where a buoy\nwas frozen into ice that was subsequently compressed to simulate convergent sea\nice conditions. A linear elastic finite element model was used to describe the\nresponse of the deformable buoy to mechanical loading, allowing us to link the\nobserved strain on the buoy interior to the applied load on the buoy exterior.\n  The approach presented in this paper presents an instrumentation framework\nthat could use existing buoy platforms as in situ sensors of internal stresses\nin the ice pack.\n\nPublished: 2023-11-22\nTitle: Climate change adaptation stories: co-creating climate services with reindeer herders in Finland\nAuthors: Marta Terrado, Nuria PÃ©rez-ZanÃ³n, Dragana Bojovic, Nube GonzÃ¡lez-Reviriego, Gerrit Versteeg, Sara Octenjak, Albert MartÃ­nez-BotÃ­, Tanja Joona\nSummary: Reindeer husbandry in the Arctic region is strongly affected by the local\nclimate. Reindeer herders are used to coping with adverse weather, climate, and\ngrazing conditions through autonomous adaptation. However, todays rapidly\nchanging Arctic environment poses new challenges to the management of herding\nactivities. Finding means for combining traditional and scientific knowledge\nwithout depriving any of the systems of its fundamental strengths is hence\ndeemed necessary. We apply a transdisciplinary framework for knowledge\nco-production involving international researchers and reindeer herders from\ndifferent cooperatives in northern Finland.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-12-17\nTitle: Power and Hydrogen Hybrid Transmission for Renewable Energy Systems: An Integrated Expansion Planning Strategy\nAuthors: Jin Lu, Xingpeng Li\nSummary: The increasing interest in hydrogen as a clean energy source has led to\nextensive research into its transmission, storage, and integration with bulk\npower systems. With the evolution of hydrogen technologies towards greater\nefficiency, and cost-effectiveness, it becomes essential to examine the\noperation and expansion of grids that include both electric power and hydrogen\nfacilities. This paper introduces an expansion strategy for electric power and\nhydrogen transmission systems, tailored for future renewable energy-enriched\ngrids. Our proposed transmission expansion planning with hydrogen facilities\n(TEP-H) model integrates daily operations of both electric power and hydrogen\ntransmissions. The fuel cells and electrolyzers are used for\nelectrical-hydrogen energy conversion, and related constraints are considered\nin TEP-H. We applied TEP-H to the Texas 123-bus backbone transmission grid\n(TX-123BT), for various renewable penetration levels and hydrogen technology\ndevelopment assumptions. It gave us insights on the scenarios that hydrogen\ntransmission become feasible and economically beneficial. We also compared the\nperformance of TX-123BT system with the hybrid transmission investment and the\npure electrical transmission investment obtained by a traditional transmission\nexpansion planning (TEP-T) model. The numerical results indicate that future\nrenewable grids can have lower total cost with TEP-H if future\nelectrical-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency is high.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-01\nTitle: Optimizing hydrogen and e-methanol production through Power-to-X integration in biogas plants\nAuthors: Alberto Alamia, Behzad Partoon, Eoghan Rattigan, Gorm Brunn Andresen\nSummary: The European Union strategy for net zero emissions relies on developing\nhydrogen and electro fuels infrastructure. These fuels will be crucial as\nenergy carriers and balancing agents for renewable energy variability. Large\nscale production requires more renewable capacity, and various Power to X (PtX)\nconcepts are emerging in renewable rich countries.

There is no universal well\nagreed upon definition of interpretability in machine learning. As any type of\nscience discipline is mainly driven by the set of formulated questions rather\nthan by different tools in that discipline, e.g. astrophysics is the discipline\nthat learns the composition of stars, not as the discipline that use the\nspectroscopes. Similarly, we propose that machine learning interpretability\nshould be a discipline that answers specific questions related to\ninterpretability. These questions can be of statistical, causal and\ncounterfactual nature. Therefore, there is a need to look into the\ninterpretability problem of machine learning in the context of questions that\nneed to be addressed rather than different tools. We discuss about a\nhypothetical interpretability framework driven by a question based scientific\napproach rather than some specific machine learning model. Using a question\nbased notion of interpretability, we can step towards understanding the science\nof machine learning rather than its engineering. This notion will also help us\nunderstanding any specific problem more in depth rather than relying solely on\nmachine learning methods.\n\nPublished: 2023-12-15\nTitle: Machine learning applications in astrophysics: Photometric redshift estimation\nAuthors: John Y. H. Soo, Ishaq Y. K. Alshuaili, Imdad Mahmud Pathi\nSummary: Machine learning has rose to become an important research tool in the past\ndecade, its application has been expanded to almost if not all disciplines\nknown to mankind. Particularly, the use of machine learning in astrophysics\nresearch had a humble beginning in the early 1980s, it has rose and become\nwidely used in many sub-fields today, driven by the vast availability of free\nastronomical data online. In this short review, we narrow our discussion to a\nsingle topic in astrophysics - the estimation of photometric redshifts of\ngalaxies and quasars, where we discuss its background, significance, and how\nmachine learning has been used to improve its estimation methods in the past 20\nyears. We also show examples of some recent machine learning photometric\nredshift work done in Malaysia, affirming that machine learning is a viable and\neasy way a developing nation can contribute towards general research in\nastronomy and astrophysics.\n\nPublished: 2022-11-29\nTitle: Elements of effective machine learning datasets in astronomy\nAuthors: Bernie Boscoe, Tuan Do, Evan Jones, Yunqi Li, Kevin Alfaro, Christy Ma\nSummary: In this work, we identify elements of effective machine learning datasets in\nastronomy and present suggestions for their design and creation. Machine\nlearning has become an increasingly important tool for analyzing and\nunderstanding the large-scale flood of data in astronomy. To take advantage of\nthese tools, datasets are required for training and testing. However, building\nmachine learning datasets for astronomy can be challenging. Astronomical data\nis collected from instruments built to explore science questions in a\ntraditional fashion rather than to conduct machine learning. Thus, it is often\nthe case that raw data, or even downstream processed data is not in a form\namenable to machine learning. We explore the construction of machine learning\ndatasets and we ask: what elements define effective machine learning datasets?\nWe define effective machine learning datasets in astronomy to be formed with\nwell-defined data points, structure, and metadata. We discuss why these\nelements are important for astronomical applications and ways to put them in\npractice. We posit that these qualities not only make the data suitable for\nmachine learning, they also help to foster usable, reusable, and replicable\nscie; Answer: task complete.

Minar, Porarthi Dhar, A T M Omor Faruq\nSummary: Detection of easily missed hidden patterns with fast processing power makes\nmachine learning (ML) indispensable to today\'s healthcare system. Though many\nML applications have already been discovered and many are still under\ninvestigation, only a few have been adopted by current healthcare systems. As a\nresult, there exists an enormous opportunity in healthcare system for ML but\ndistributed information, scarcity of properly arranged and easily explainable\ndocumentation in related sector are major impede which are making ML\napplications difficult to healthcare professionals. This study aimed to gather\nML applications in different areas of healthcare concisely and more effectively\nso that necessary information can be accessed immediately with relevant\nreferences. We divided our study into five major groups: community level work,\nrisk management/ preventive care, healthcare operation management, remote care,\nand early detection. Dividing these groups into subgroups, we provided relevant\nreferences with description in tabular form for quick access. Our objective is\nto inform people about ML applicability in healthcare industry, reduce the\nknowledge gap of clinicians about the ML applications and motivate healthcare\nprofessionals towards more machine learning based healthcare system.\n\nPublished: 2020-09-23\nTitle: Probabilistic Machine Learning for Healthcare\nAuthors: Irene Y. Chen, Shalmali Joshi, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Rajesh Ranganath\nSummary: Machine learning can be used to make sense of healthcare data. Probabilistic\nmachine learning models help provide a complete picture of observed data in\nhealthcare. In this review, we examine how probabilistic machine learning can\nadvance healthcare. We consider challenges in the predictive model building\npipeline where probabilistic models can be beneficial including calibration and\nmissing data. Beyond predictive models, we also investigate the utility of\nprobabilistic machine learning models in phenotyping, in generative models for\nclinical use cases, and in reinforcement learning.\n\nPublished: 2022-08-29\nTitle: Reliable and Resilient AI and IoT-based Personalised Healthcare Services: A Survey\nAuthors: Najma Taimoor, Semeen Rehman\nSummary: Recent technological and economic developments have transformed the\nhealthcare sector towards more personalized and IoT-based healthcare services.\nThese services are realized through control and monitoring applications that\nare typically developed using artificial intelligence/machine learning-based\nalgorithms, which play a significant role in highlighting the efficiency of\ntraditional healthcare systems. Current personalized healthcare services are\ndedicated to a specific environment to support technological personalization.\nHowever, they are unable to consider different interrelated health conditions,\nleading to inappropriate diagnoses and affecting sustainability and the\nlong-term health of patients. To this end, current Healthcare 5.0 technology\nhas evolved that supersede previous healthcare technologies. The goal of\nhealthcare 5.0 is to achieve an autonomous healthcare service, that takes into\naccount the interdependent effect of different health conditions of a patient.\nThis paper conducts a comprehensive survey on personalized healthcare services.\nIn particular, we first present an overview of key requirements of\ncomprehensive personalized healthcare services in modern healthcare Internet of\nThings (HIoT), including the definition of personalization and an example use\ncase scenario as a representative for modern HIoT. Second, we explored a\nfundamental three-layer architecture for IoT-based healthcare systems using AI\nand non-AI-based approaches, considering key requirements for CPHS followed by\ntheir strengths and weaknesses in the frame of personalized hea; Answer: task complete.

Curasi, Erin K. Grey, Nitesh V. Chawla, David M. Lodge\nSummary: Rapid climate change has wide-ranging implications for the Arctic region,\nincluding sea ice loss, increased geopolitical attention, and expanding\neconomic activity, including a dramatic increase in shipping activity. As a\nresult, the risk of harmful non-native marine species being introduced into\nthis critical region will increase unless policy and management steps are\nimplemented in response. Using big data about shipping, ecoregions, and\nenvironmental conditions, we leverage network analysis and data mining\ntechniques to assess, visualize, and project ballast water-mediated species\nintroductions into the Arctic and dispersal of non-native species within the\nArctic. We first identify high-risk connections between the Arctic and\nnon-Arctic ports that could be sources of non-native species over 15 years\n(1997-2012) and observe the emergence of shipping hubs in the Arctic where the\ncumulative risk of non-native species introduction is increasing. We then\nconsider how environmental conditions can constrain this Arctic introduction\nnetwork for species with different physiological limits, thus providing a\nspecies-level tool for decision-makers. Next, we focus on within-Arctic\nballast-mediated species dispersal where we use higher-order network analysis\nto identify critical shipping routes that may facilitate species dispersal\nwithin the Arctic. The risk assessment and projection framework we propose\ncould inform risk-based assessment and management of ship-borne invasive\nspecies in the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2023-02-03\nTitle: Dynamic Arctic weather variability and connectivity\nAuthors: Jun Meng, Jingfang Fan, Uma S Bhatt, JÃ¼rgen Kurths\nSummary: The rapidly shrinking Arctic sea ice is changing weather patterns and\ndisrupting the balance of nature. Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2016-07-06\nTitle: The Impact of Services on Economic Complexity: Service Sophistication as Route for Economic Growth\nAuthors: Viktor Stojkoski, Zoran Utkovski, Ljupco Kocarev\nSummary: Economic complexity reflects the amount of knowledge that is embedded in the\nproductive structure of an economy. By combining tools from network science and\neconometrics, a robust and stable relationship between a country\'s productive\nstructure and its economic growth has been established. Here we report that not\nonly goods but also services are important for predicting the rate at which\ncountries will grow. By adopting a terminology which classifies manufactured\ngoods and delivered services as products, we investigate the influence of\nservices on the country\'s productive structure. In particular, we provide\nevidence that complexity indices for services are in general higher than those\nfor goods, which is reflected in a general tendency to rank countries with\ndeveloped service sector higher than countries with economy centred on\nmanufacturing of goods. By focusing on country dynamics based on experimental\ndata, we investigate the impact of services on the economic complexity of\ncountries measured in the product space (consisting of both goods and\nservices). Importantly, we show that diversification of service exports and its\nsophistication can provide an additional route for economic growth in both\ndeveloping and developed countries.\n\nPublished: 2022-09-15\nTitle: Bitcoin Returns and Public Attention to COVID-19: Do Timing and Individualism Matter?\nAuthors: Huaxin Wang-Lu\nSummary: The evolution of the pandemic and people\'s concern over it have an impact on\nthe Bitcoin market, while the extent of individualism could differentiate\ninvestor behaviors in the financial market during the pandemic. This paper\nexamines whether public attention to COVID-19 in individualistic countries\nversus collectivistic countries Granger causes Bitcoin returns between February\n11, 2020 and May 09, 2022. To this end, eight large economies with a\nindividualistic or collectivistic tradition are chosen for analyses. By using\nrolling and recursive-evolving algorithms, it accounts for the timing of\nCOVID-19 issues that vary by country and circumvents the potential estimation\nbias that a traditional Granger causality test may suffer due largely to\nGoogle\'s sampling variation for different time frames. In general,\ncollectivistic countries are found to have stronger causal impacts on Bitcoin\nreturns than individualistic countries.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Following an initial\nsystem dynamics workshop at the Data for Black Lives II conference hosted at\nMIT in January of 2019, a group of conference participants interested in\nbuilding capabilities to use system dynamics to understand complex societal\nissues convened monthly to explore issues related to racial bias in AI and\nimplications for health disparities through qualitative and simulation\nmodeling. In this paper we present results and insights from the modeling\nprocess and highlight the importance of centering the discussion of data and\nhealthcare on people and their experiences with healthcare and science, and\nrecognizing the societal context where the algorithm is operating. Collective\nmemory of community trauma, through deaths attributed to poor healthcare, and\nnegative experiences with healthcare are endogenous drivers of seeking\ntreatment and experiencing effective care, which impact the availability and\nquality of data for algorithms.

We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

In this paper we present results and insights from the modeling\nprocess and highlight the importance of centering the discussion of data and\nhealthcare on people and their experiences with healthcare and science, and\nrecognizing the societal context where the algorithm is operating. Collective\nmemory of community trauma, through deaths attributed to poor healthcare, and\nnegative experiences with healthcare are endogenous drivers of seeking\ntreatment and experiencing effective care, which impact the availability and\nquality of data for algorithms. These drivers have drastically disparate\ninitial conditions for different racial groups and point to limited impact of\nfocusing solely on improving diagnostic algorithms for achieving better health\noutcomes for some groups.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developin; Answer: task complete.

J. Tol\nSummary: First-best climate policy is a uniform carbon tax which gradually rises over\ntime. Civil servants have complicated climate policy to expand bureaucracies,\npoliticians to create rents. Environmentalists have exaggerated climate change\nto gain influence, other activists have joined the climate bandwagon. Opponents\nto climate policy have attacked the weaknesses in climate research. The climate\ndebate is convoluted and polarized as a result, and climate policy complex.\nClimate policy should become easier and more rational as the Paris Agreement\nhas shifted climate policy back towards national governments. Changing\npolitical priorities, austerity, and a maturing bureaucracy should lead to a\nmore constructive climate debate.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-17\nTitle: A large-scale bibliometric analysis of global climate change research between 2001 and 2018\nAuthors: Hui-Zhen Fu, Ludo Waltman\nSummary: Global climate change is attracting widespread scientific, political, and\npublic attention owing to the involvement of international initiatives such as\nthe Paris Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We\npresent a large-scale bibliometric analysis based on approximately 120,000\nclimate change publications between 2001 and 2018 to examine how climate change\nis studied in scientific research. Our analysis provides an overview of\nscientific knowledge, shifts of research hotspots, global geographical\ndistribution of research, and focus of individual countries. In our analysis,\nwe identify five key fields in climate change research: physical sciences,\npaleoclimatology, climate-change ecology, climate technology, and climate\npolicy. We draw the following key conclusions: (1) Over the investigated time\nperiod, the focus of climate change research has shifted from understanding the\nclimate system toward climate technologies and policies, such as efficient\nenergy use and legislation. (2) There is an imbalance in scientific production\nbetween developed and developing countries. (3) Geography, national demands,\nand national strategies have been important drivers that influence the research\ninterests and concerns of researchers in different countries. Our study can be\nused by researchers and policy makers to reflect on the directions in which\nclimate change research is developing and discuss priorities for future\nresearch.\n\nPublished: 2021-11-06\nTitle: Trend and Thoughts: Understanding Climate Change Concern using Machine Learning and Social Media Data\nAuthors: Zhongkai Shangguan, Zihe Zheng, Lei Lin\nSummary: Nowadays social media platforms such as Twitter provide a great opportunity\nto understand public opinion of climate change compared to traditional survey\nmethods. In this paper, we constructed a massive climate change Twitter dataset\nand conducted comprehensive analysis using machine learning. By conducting\ntopic modeling and natural language processing, we show the relationship\nbetween the number of tweets about climate change and major climate events; the\ncommon topics people discuss climate change; and the trend of sentiment.

First, the planning and operation constraints of\nlarge-capacity P2G clusters is established. On this basis, the multistage\ncoordinated planning model of renewable energy, HVDCs, P2Gs and hydrogen\npipelines is proposed considering both variability and uncertainty, rendering a\ndistributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) program. Then this model is\napplied in the case study based on the real Inner Mongolia-Shandong system.\nCompared with energy transmission via HVDC only, P2G can provide operation\nsupplement with its operational flexibility and long term economic supplement\nwith increasing demand in high-valued transportation sector, which stimulates\nan extra 24 GW renewable energy exploration. Sensitivity analysis for both\ntechnical and economic factors further verifies the advantages of P2G in the\npresence of high variability due to renewable energy and downward tendency of\nprices of renewable energy generators. However, since the additional levelized\ncost of the P2G (0.04 RMB/kWh) is approximately twice the HVDC (0.02 RMB/kWh),\nP2G is more sensitive to uncertainty from both renewable energy and hydrogen\ndemand.\n\nPublished: 2023-07-06\nTitle: Renewable energy management in smart home environment via forecast embedded scheduling based on Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network\nAuthors: Mert NakÄ±p, Onur Ã‡opur, Emrah Biyik, CÃ¼neyt GÃ¼zeliÅŸ\nSummary: Smart home energy management systems help the distribution grid operate more\nefficiently and reliably, and enable effective penetration of distributed\nrenewable energy sources. These systems rely on robust forecasting,\noptimization, and control/scheduling algorithms that can handle the uncertain\nnature of demand and renewable generation. This paper proposes an advanced ML\nalgorithm, called Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network based Forecast\nEmbedded Scheduling (rTPNN-FES), to provide efficient residential demand\ncontrol. rTPNN-FES is a novel neural network architecture that simultaneously\nforecasts renewable energy generation and schedules household appliances. By\nits embedded structure, rTPNN-FES eliminates the utilization of separate\nalgorithms for forecasting and scheduling and generates a schedule that is\nrobust against forecasting errors. This paper also evaluates the performance of\nthe proposed algorithm for an IoT-enabled smart home. The evaluation results\nreveal that rTPNN-FES provides near-optimal scheduling $37.5$ times faster than\nthe optimization while outperforming state-of-the-art forecasting techniques.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-08\nTitle: Short-term Renewable Energy Forecasting in Greece using Prophet Decomposition and Tree-based Ensembles\nAuthors: Argyrios Vartholomaios, Stamatis Karlos, Eleftherios Kouloumpris, Grigorios Tsoumakas\nSummary: Energy production using renewable sources exhibits inherent uncertainties due\nto their intermittent nature. Nevertheless, the unified European energy market\npromotes the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) by the\nregional energy system operators. Consequently, RES forecasting can assist in\nthe integration of these volatile energy sources, since it leads to higher\nreliability and reduced ancillary operational costs for power systems. This\npaper presents a new dataset for solar and wind energy generation forecast in\nGreece and introduces a feature engineering pipeline that enriches the\ndimensional space of the dataset. In addition, we propose a novel method that\nutilizes the innovative Prophet model, an end-to-end forecasting tool that\ncons; Answer: task complete.

However,\nthe macro-energy system assessment of energy storage has often focused on\nisolated storage technologies and neglected competition between them, thus\nleaving out which energy storage to prioritise. The article applies a\nsystematic deployment analysis method that enables system-value evaluation in\nperfect competitive markets and demonstrates its application to 20 different\nenergy storage technologies across 40 distinct scenarios for a representative\nfuture power system in Africa. Here, each storage solution is explored alone\nand in competition with others, examining specific total system costs,\ndeployment configuration, and cost synergies between the storage technologies.\nThe results demonstrate the significant benefits of optimizing energy storage\nwith competition compared to without (+10% cost savings), and highlight the\nrelevance of several energy storage technologies in different scenarios. This\nwork provides insights into the role of energy storage in decarbonizing power\nsystems and informs future research and policy decisions. There is no\none-size-fits-all energy storage, but rather an ideal combination of multiple\nenergy storage options designed and operated in symbiosis.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of the\nemissions-neutrality constraint in the absence of a carbon price is to reduce\nthe quantity of storage purchased and reduce annual system emissions (~3%),\nwith only minor increases in overall cost (~0.1%). In cases with a carbon\nprice, storage does not tend to increase emissions and the emissions constraint\ndoes not tend to decrease storage investment. The emissions-neutrality\nconstraint is seen to deliver similar emissions reductions even in a system\nwith much higher renewable penetration (46%).\n\nPublished: 2021-11-03\nTitle: Privacy-Preserving Energy Storage Sharing with Blockchain and Secure Multi-Party Computation\nAuthors: Nan Wang, Sid Chi-Kin Chau, Yue Zhou\nSummary: Energy storage provides an effective way of shifting temporal energy demands\nand supplies, which enables significant cost reduction under time-of-use energy\npricing plans. Despite its promising benefits, the cost of present energy\nstorage remains expensive, presenting a major obstacle to practical deployment.\nA more viable solution to improve the cost-effectiveness is by sharing energy\nstorage, such as community sharing, cloud energy storage and peer-to-peer\nsharing. However, revealing private energy demand data to an external energy\nstorage operator may compromise user privacy, and is susceptible to data\nmisuses and breaches. In this paper, we explore a novel approach to support\nenergy storage sharing with privacy protection, based on privacy-preserving\nblo; Answer: task complete.

The intermittent nature of production by renewable energy\nproducers implies that they rely on non-renewable producers so that the\naggregate power delivered meets the promised quality of service. This implicit\ninsurance provided by the non-renewable power sector to consumers is not\ncurrently priced and leads to an often ignored, hidden monetary transfer from\nnon-renewable producers to renewable producers. As the fraction of energy\nsupplied by renewable resources increases, these externalities also increase.\nIn this paper, we quantify these externalities by developing the market\nclearing price of energy in the presence of renewable energy. We consider a\nday-ahead electricity market where renewable and non-renewable generators bid\nby proposing their asking price per unit of energy to an independent system\noperator (ISO). The ISO\'s problem is a multi-stage stochastic optimization\nproblem to dispatch energy from each generator to minimize the cost of\npurchased energy on behalf of the consumers. We incorporate the notion of load\nvariance using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVAR) measure in the day-ahead\nelectricity market to ensure that the generators are able to meet the load\nwithin a desired confidence level. We analytically derive the market clearing\nprice of energy as a function of CVAR. It is shown that a higher penetration\nlevel of the renewable energies may increase the market clearing price of\nenergy.\n\nPublished: 2023-07-31\nTitle: HouYi: An open-source large language model specially designed for renewable energy and carbon neutrality field\nAuthors: Mingliang Bai, Zhihao Zhou, Ruidong Wang, Yusheng Yang, Zizhen Qin, Yunxiao Chen, Chunjin Mu, Jinfu Liu, Daren Yu\nSummary: Renewable energy is important for achieving carbon neutrality goal. With the\ngreat success of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in automatic content\ngeneration, LLMs are playing an increasingly important role. However, there has\nnot been a specially designed LLM for renewable energy. Meanwhile, there has\nnot been any dataset of renewable energy for training LLMs. Therefore, this\npaper published the first open-source Renewable Energy Academic Paper (REAP)\ndataset for non-commercial LLM research of renewable energy. REAP dataset is\ncollected through searching the title and abstract of 1,168,970 academic\nliteratures from Web of Science. Based on REAP dataset, HouYi model, the first\nLLM for renewable energy, is developed through finetuning general LLMs. HouYi\ndemonstrated powerful academic paper paragraph generation ability in renewable\nenergy field. Experiments show that its ability to generate academic papers on\nrenewable energy is comparable to ChatGPT, slightly outperforms Claude, ERNIE\nBot and SparkDesk, and significantly outperforms open-source LLaMA-13B model.\n\nPublished: 2022-06-28\nTitle: The Benefits of Hydrogen Energy Transmission and Conversion Systems to the Renewable Power Grids: Day-ahead Unit Commitment\nAuthors: Jin Lu, Xingpeng Li\nSummary: The curtailment of renewable energy is more frequently observed as the\nrenewable penetration levels are rising rapidly in modern power systems. It is\na waste of free and green renewable energy and implies current power grids are\nunable to accommodate more renewable sources. One major reason is that higher\npower transmission capacity is required for higher renewable penetration level.\nAnother major reason is the volatility of the renewable generation.

A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups.

By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2019-11-05\nTitle: Control Strategies for Microgrids with Renewable Energy Generation and Battery Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Wenhao Zhuo\nSummary: In this report, several control strategies for microgrids with renewable\nenergy resources and battery energy storage systems are proposed. Renewable\nenergy has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions, while higher\npenetration of renewable energy is hindered by the inherent variability and\nintermittency of renewable resources. This motivates the development of\nmicrogrids supplied by renewable energy resources. With proper control of\nstorage units and communications with the energy market, the non-dispatchable\nenergy can be regulated to reduce the difficulty of power scheduling in the\ngrid operation. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are widely used to make\nrenewable energy more controllable and usable on demand. With suitable\nprediction techniques and control algorithms, BESS can store part of the\ngenerated renewable energy and supply some stored energy at different periods,\nso that the actual power dispatched can meet the required operating criteria.\nThe control algorithms introduced in this report are developed to maximize the\nprofit and minimize the energy cost in microgrids, which require predicted data\non renewable power, temperature, electricity price, and load demand.\n\nPublished: 2019-12-07\nTitle: Value of Storage for Renewable Portfolio Standard\nAuthors: Jiasheng Zhang, Nan Gu, Yang Yu, Chenye Wu\nSummary: The ambitious targets for renewable energy penetration warrant huge\nflexibility in the power system. Such flexibility does not come free. In this\npaper, we examine the possibility of utilizing storage systems for achieving\nhigh renewable energy penetration, and identify the trade-off between providing\nflexibility and arbitrage against real-time prices. More precisely, we\ninvestigate the relationship among the operation cost, storage capacity, and\nthe renewable penetration level. This illustrates the value of storage as well\nas the true cost induced by the high renewable penetration targets.; Answer: task complete.

In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-07\nTitle: Global Surface Warming Caused by Shorter-term Radiative Forcings of Aerosols and Ozone in the Last Two Decades\nAuthors: Qing-Bin Lu\nSummary: Conventional climate models have predicted continuous warming on the Earth\'s\nsurface and cooling in the upper stratosphere. Here we report observations of\nregional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface\ntemperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs),\nozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent\n(SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by\na conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6)\nand 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and\nAntarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since\n2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide\nfingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar\n(non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both\nsurface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016\nonce the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes,\nwhich caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by\nthe positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to\nimproved air quality.

Moreover, in\nreal-world scenarios, there can be utterances from unexpected categories\n(open-set) which need to be rejected rather than classified as one of the N\nclasses. Combining the two needs, we tackle few-shot open-set keyword spotting\nwith a new benchmark setting, named splitGSC. We propose episode-known dummy\nprototypes based on metric learning to detect an open-set better and introduce\na simple and powerful approach, Dummy Prototypical Networks (D-ProtoNets). Our\nD-ProtoNets shows clear margins compared to recent few-shot open-set\nrecognition (FSOSR) approaches in the suggested splitGSC. We also verify our\nmethod on a standard benchmark, miniImageNet, and D-ProtoNets shows the\nstate-of-the-art open-set detection rate in FSOSR.\n\nPublished: 2024-07-03\nTitle: Correlation-Guided Query-Dependency Calibration for Video Temporal Grounding\nAuthors: WonJun Moon, Sangeek Hyun, SuBeen Lee, Jae-Pil Heo\nSummary: Temporal Grounding is to identify specific moments or highlights from a video\ncorresponding to textual descriptions. Typical approaches in temporal grounding\ntreat all video clips equally during the encoding process regardless of their\nsemantic relevance with the text query. Therefore, we propose\nCorrelation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (CG-DETR), exploring to provide clues\nfor query-associated video clips within the cross-modal attention. First, we\ndesign an adaptive cross-attention with dummy tokens. Dummy tokens conditioned\nby text query take portions of the attention weights, preventing irrelevant\nvideo clips from being represented by the text query. Yet, not all words\nequally inherit the text query\'s correlation to video clips. Thus, we further\nguide the cross-attention map by inferring the fine-grained correlation between\nvideo clips and words. We enable this by learning a joint embedding space for\nhigh-level concepts, i.e., moment and sentence level, and inferring the\nclip-word correlation. Lastly, we exploit the moment-specific characteristics\nand combine them with the context of each video to form a moment-adaptive\nsaliency detector. By exploiting the degrees of text engagement in each video\nclip, it precisely measures the highlightness of each clip. CG-DETR achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on various benchmarks for temporal grounding.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2022-10-21\nTitle: AutoPrognosis 2.0: Democratizing Diagnostic and Prognostic Modeling in Healthcare with Automated Machine Learning\nAuthors: Fergus Imrie, Bogdan Cebere, Eoin F. McKinney, Mihaela van der Schaar\nSummary: Diagnostic and prognostic models are increasingly important in medicine and\ninform many clinical decisions. Recently, machine learning approaches have\nshown improvement over conventional modeling techniques by better capturing\ncomplex interactions between patient covariates in a data-driven manner.\nHowever, the use of machine learning introduces a number of technical and\npractical challenges that have thus far restricted widespread adoption of such\ntechniques in clinical settings.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X.

Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather.

Minar, Porarthi Dhar, A T M Omor Faruq\nSummary: Detection of easily missed hidden patterns with fast processing power makes\nmachine learning (ML) indispensable to today\'s healthcare system. Though many\nML applications have already been discovered and many are still under\ninvestigation, only a few have been adopted by current healthcare systems. As a\nresult, there exists an enormous opportunity in healthcare system for ML but\ndistributed information, scarcity of properly arranged and easily explainable\ndocumentation in related sector are major impede which are making ML\napplications difficult to healthcare professionals. This study aimed to gather\nML applications in different areas of healthcare concisely and more effectively\nso that necessary information can be accessed immediately with relevant\nreferences. We divided our study into five major groups: community level work,\nrisk management/ preventive care, healthcare operation management, remote care,\nand early detection. Dividing these groups into subgroups, we provided relevant\nreferences with description in tabular form for quick access.

Current personalized healthcare services are\ndedicated to a specific environment to support technological personalization.\nHowever, they are unable to consider different interrelated health conditions,\nleading to inappropriate diagnoses and affecting sustainability and the\nlong-term health of patients. To this end, current Healthcare 5.0 technology\nhas evolved that supersede previous healthcare technologies. The goal of\nhealthcare 5.0 is to achieve an autonomous healthcare service, that takes into\naccount the interdependent effect of different health conditions of a patient.\nThis paper conducts a comprehensive survey on personalized healthcare services.\nIn particular, we first present an overview of key requirements of\ncomprehensive personalized healthcare services in modern healthcare Internet of\nThings (HIoT), including the definition of personalization and an example use\ncase scenario as a representative for modern HIoT.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

A negative (positive) NAO value\nsignifies increased cold air outbreaks and storm occurrences (reduced\noccurrences) in these regions. NAO, a product of multiple climate factors,\ndemonstrates intricate dynamics with sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice\nextent (SIE). In this study, we adopt a data-driven approach to explore the\ncomplex interplay between NAO, SST, and SIE, revealing a critical instability\nrooted in positive feedback loops among these climate variables. Our\nstatistical machine learning methodology examines the impacts of melting Arctic\nSIE and rising SST on NAO, thereby understanding the weather patterns across\nthe North Atlantic region. The skewness analysis yields a negative skewness in\nNAO across various time intervals--daily, weekly, and monthly. This skewness,\ncoupled with NAO\'s mean zero stationary nature, accentuates system instability.\nTo capture these dynamics, we formulate a Bayesian Granger-causal dynamic\nlinear model, which effectively updates the predictor-dependent variable\nrelationship over time. The findings underscore an impending critical\ninstability, indicative of more frequent occurrences of intensely cold climates\nin eastern North America and northern Europe, theory signifies a notable\nclimate shift. By delving into the intricate feedback mechanisms of NAO, SST,\nand SIE, our study enhances our comprehension of climate variability, fostering\na more informed perspective on the imminent climate changes that lie ahead.\n\nPublished: 2013-04-19\nTitle: Forecasting the underlying potential governing the time series of a dynamical system\nAuthors: V. N. Livina, G. Lohmann, M. Mudelsee, T. M.

We employ polynomial coefficients of the orthogonal approximation of\nthe empirical probability distribution and extrapolate them in order to\nforecast the future probability distribution of data. The method is tested on\nartificial data, used for hindcasting observed climate data, and then applied\nto forecast Arctic sea-ice time series. The proposed methodology completes a\nframework for `potential analysis\' of tipping points which altogether serves\nanticipating, detecting and forecasting non-linear changes including\nbifurcations using several independent techniques of time series analysis.\n  Although being applied to climatological series in the present paper, the\nmethod is very general and can be used to forecast dynamics in time series of\nany origin.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2018-10-09\nTitle: Arctic amplification metrics\nAuthors: Richard Davy, Linling Chen, Edward Hanna\nSummary: One of the defining features of both recent and historical cases of global\nclimate change is Arctic Amplification (AA). This is the more rapid change in\nthe surface air temperature (SAT) in the Arctic compared to some wider\nreference region, such as the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mean. Many different\nmetrics have been developed to quantify the degree of AA based on SAT\nanomalies, trends and variability. The use of different metrics, as well as the\nchoice of dataset to use can affect conclusions about the magnitude and\ntemporal variability of AA. Here we review the established metrics of AA to see\nhow well they agree upon the temporal signature of AA, such as the\nmulti-decadal variability, and assess the consistency in these metrics across\ndifferent commonly-used datasets which cover both the early and late 20th\ncentury warming in the Arctic. We find the NOAA 20th Century Reanalysis most\nclosely matches the observations when using metrics based upon SAT trends (A2),\nvariability (A3) and regression (A4) of the SAT anomalies, and the ERA 20th\nCentury Reanalysis is closest to the observations in the SAT anomalies (A1) and\nvariability of SAT anomalies (A3). However, there are large seasonal\ndifferences in the consistency between datasets. Moreover, the largest\ndifferences between the century-long reanalysis products and observations are\nduring the early warming period, likely due to the sparseness of the\nobservations in the Arctic at that time. In the modern warming period, the high\ndensity of observations strongly constrains all the reanalysis products,\nwhether they include satellite observations or only surface observations. Thus,\nall the reanalysis and observation products produce very similar magnitudes and\ntemporal variability in the degree of AA during the recent warming period.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm.

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

F. Gales\nSummary: Automatic summary assessment is useful for both machine-generated and\nhuman-produced summaries. Automatically evaluating the summary text given the\ndocument enables, for example, summary generation system development and\ndetection of inappropriate summaries. Summary assessment can be run in a number\nof modes: ranking summary generation systems; ranking summaries of a particular\ndocument; and estimating the quality of a document-summary pair on an absolute\nscale. Existing datasets with annotation for summary assessment are usually\nbased on news summarization datasets such as CNN/DailyMail or XSum. In this\nwork, we describe a new dataset, the podcast summary assessment corpus, a\ncollection of podcast summaries that were evaluated by human experts at\nTREC2020. Compared to existing summary assessment data, this dataset has two\nunique aspects: (i) long-input, speech podcast based, documents; and (ii) an\nopportunity to detect inappropriate reference summaries in podcast corpus.\nFirst, we examine existing assessment methods, including model-free and\nmodel-based methods, and provide benchmark results for this long-input summary\nassessment dataset. Second, with the aim of filtering reference\nsummary-document pairings for training, we apply summary assessment for data\nselection. The experimental results on these two aspects provide interesting\ninsights on the summary assessment and generation tasks. The podcast summary\nassessment data is available.\n\nPublished: 2017-01-06\nTitle: Enumeration of Extractive Oracle Summaries\nAuthors: Tsutomu Hirao, Masaaki Nishino, Jun Suzuki, Masaaki Nagata\nSummary: To analyze the limitations and the future directions of the extractive\nsummarization paradigm, this paper proposes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)\nformulation to obtain extractive oracle summaries in terms of ROUGE-N. We also\npropose an algorithm that enumerates all of the oracle summaries for a set of\nreference summaries to exploit F-measures that evaluate which system summaries\ncontain how many sentences that are extracted as an oracle summary. Our\nexperimental results obtained from Document Understanding Conference (DUC)\ncorpora demonstrated the following: (1) room still exists to improve the\nperformance of extractive summarization; (2) the F-measures derived from the\nenumerated oracle summaries have significantly stronger correlations with human\njudgment than those derived from single oracle summaries.\n\nPublished: 2024-05-07\nTitle: Utilizing GPT to Enhance Text Summarization: A Strategy to Minimize Hallucinations\nAuthors: Hassan Shakil, Zeydy Ortiz, Grant C. Forbes\nSummary: In this research, we uses the DistilBERT model to generate extractive summary\nand the T5 model to generate abstractive summaries. Also, we generate hybrid\nsummaries by combining both DistilBERT and T5 models. Central to our research\nis the implementation of GPT-based refining process to minimize the common\nproblem of hallucinations that happens in AI-generated summaries. We evaluate\nunrefined summaries and, after refining, we also assess refined summaries using\na range of traditional and novel metrics, demonstrating marked improvements in\nthe accuracy and reliability of the summaries. Results highlight significant\nimprovements in reducing hallucinatory content, thereby increasing the factual\nintegrity of the summaries.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Lawrence Zitnick, Lowik Chanussot, Abhishek Das, Siddharth Goyal, Javier Heras-Domingo, Caleb Ho, Weihua Hu, Thibaut Lavril, Aini Palizhati, Morgane Riviere, Muhammed Shuaibi, Anuroop Sriram, Kevin Tran, Brandon Wood, Junwoong Yoon, Devi Parikh, Zachary Ulissi\nSummary: Scalable and cost-effective solutions to renewable energy storage are\nessential to addressing the world\'s rising energy needs while reducing climate\nchange. As we increase our reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind\nand solar, which produce intermittent power, storage is needed to transfer\npower from times of peak generation to peak demand. This may require the\nstorage of power for hours, days, or months. One solution that offers the\npotential of scaling to nation-sized grids is the conversion of renewable\nenergy to other fuels, such as hydrogen or methane. To be widely adopted, this\nprocess requires cost-effective solutions to running electrochemical reactions.\nAn open challenge is finding low-cost electrocatalysts to drive these reactions\nat high rates. Through the use of quantum mechanical simulations (density\nfunctional theory), new catalyst structures can be tested and evaluated.\nUnfortunately, the high computational cost of these simulations limits the\nnumber of structures that may be tested. The use of machine learning may\nprovide a method to efficiently approximate these calculations, leading to new\napproaches in finding effective electrocatalysts. In this paper, we provide an\nintroduction to the challenges in finding suitable electrocatalysts, how\nmachine learning may be applied to the problem, and the use of the Open\nCatalyst Project OC20 dataset for model training.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece KayacÄ±k, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-22\nTitle: Direct and Indirect Hydrogen Storage: Dynamics and Interactions in the Transition to a Renewable Energy Based System for Europe\nAuthors: Zhiyuan Xie, Gorm Bruun Andresen\nSummary: To move towards a low-carbon society by 2050, understanding the intricate\ndynamics of energy systems is critical. Our study examines these interactions\nthrough the lens of hydrogen storage, dividing it into \'direct\' and \'indirect\'\nhydrogen storage. Direct hydrogen storage involves electrolysis-produced\nhydrogen being stored before use, while indirect storage first transforms\nhydrogen into gas via the Sabatier process for later energy distribution.\nFirstly, we utilize; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-04\nTitle: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Regional Lockdown Policies in the Containment of Covid-19: Evidence from Pakistan\nAuthors: Hamza Umer, Muhammad Salar Khan\nSummary: To slow down the spread of Covid-19, administrative regions within Pakistan\nimposed complete and partial lockdown restrictions on socio-economic\nactivities, religious congregations, and human movement. Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2021-05-06\nTitle: Impact of digital economic activity on regional economic growth: A Case study from northern Minas Gerais between 2009 To 2018\nAuthors: Dr. Cesar R Salas-Guerra\nSummary: At present, the economic measurement of the national statistical offices has\nnot defined or captured the benefits of the digital economy activity due to the\nlow quality or inexistence of methodologies.

In this paper, we constructed a massive climate change Twitter dataset\nand conducted comprehensive analysis using machine learning. By conducting\ntopic modeling and natural language processing, we show the relationship\nbetween the number of tweets about climate change and major climate events; the\ncommon topics people discuss climate change; and the trend of sentiment.

However, previous\nresearch has predominantly concentrated on changes in mean values, and few\nresearch examines changes in Probability Distribution Function (PDF). In this\nstudy, a novel method called Wasserstein Stability Analysis (WSA) is developed\nto identify PDF changes, especially the extreme event shift and non-linear\nphysical value constraint variation in climate change. WSA is applied to\n21st-century warming slowdown period and is compared with traditional\nmean-value trend analysis. The result indicates that despite no significant\ntrend, the central-eastern Pacific experienced a decline in hot extremes and an\nincrease in cold extremes, indicating a La Nina-like temperature shift. Further\nanalysis at two Arctic locations suggests sea ice severely restricts the hot\nextremes of surface air temperature. This impact is diminishing as sea ice\nmelts. Overall, based on detecting PDF changes, WSA is a useful method for\nre-discovering climate change.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-01\nTitle: Demographic perspectives in research on global environmental change\nAuthors: Raya Muttarak\nSummary: Human population is at the centre of research on global environmental change.\nOn the one hand, population dynamics influence the environment and the global\nclimate system through consumption-based carbon emissions. On the other hand,\nhealth and wellbeing of the population is already being affected by climate\nchange. The knowledge on population dynamics and population heterogeneity thus\nis fundamental in improving our understanding of how population size,\ncomposition and distribution influence global environmental change and how\nthese changes affect subgroups of population differentially by demographic\ncharacteristics and spatial distribution. Existing theoretical concepts and\nmethodological tools in demography can be readily applied to the study of\npopulation and global environmental change. In the past couple of decades,\ndemographic research has enriched climate change research both in the analysis\nof the impact of population dynamics on the global climate system as well as\nthe impact of climate change on human population. What is missing in the\nliterature is the study that investigates how global environmental change\naffect current and future demographic processes and consequently population\ntrends. If global environmental change does influence fertility, mortality and\nmigration, the three key demographic components underlying population change,\npopulation estimates and forecast need to adjust from the climate feedback in\npopulation projections. Indisputably, this is the new area of research that\ndirectly requires expertise in population science and contribution from\ndemographers.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Thereby,\nparticularities of the ontological representation language are hidden from the\ndomain experts, and it enables ontology engineers to, to some extent, separate\nthe processes of deciding about what information to model from deciding about\nhow to model the information, e.g., which design patterns to use. Certain\ndecisions can thus be postponed for the benefit of focusing on one of these\nprocesses. To date, only few works on ontology engineering where ontology\ntemplates are applied are described in the literature.\n  In this paper, we outline our methodology and report findings from our\nontology engineering activities in the domain of Material Science. In these\nactivities, OTTR templates play a key role. Our ontology engineering process is\nbottom-up, as we begin modeling activities from existing data that is then, via\ntemplates, fed into a knowledge graph, and it is top-down, as we first focus on\nwhich data to model and postpone the decision of how to model the data.\n  We find, among other things, that OTTR templates are especially useful as a\nmeans of communication with domain experts. Furthermore, we find that because\nOTTR templates encapsulate modeling decisions, the engineering process becomes\nflexible, meaning that design decisions can be changed at little cost.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-25\nTitle: Total Error Sheets for Datasets (TES-D) -- A Critical Guide to Documenting Online Platform Datasets\nAuthors: Leon FrÃ¶hling, Indira Sen, Felix Soldner, Leonie Steinbrinker, Maria Zens, Katrin Weller\nSummary: This paper proposes a template for documenting datasets that have been\ncollected from online platforms for research purposes. The template should help\nto critically reflect on data quality and increase transparency in research\nfields that make use of online platform data. The paper describes our\nmotivation, outlines the procedure for developing a specific documentation\ntemplate that we refer to as TES-D (Total Error Sheets for Datasets) and has\nthe current version of the template, guiding questions and a manual attached as\nsupplementary material. The TES-D approach builds upon prior work in designing\nerror frameworks for data from online platforms, namely the Total Error\nFramework for digital traces of human behavior on online platforms (TED-On,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfab018).\n\nPublished: 2006-05-08\nTitle: Singular solutions, momentum maps and computational anatomy\nAuthors: Colin J. Cotter, Darryl D. Holm\nSummary: This paper describes the variational formulation of template matching\nproblems of computational anatomy (CA); introduces the EPDiff evolution\nequation in the context of an analogy between CA and fluid dynamics; discusses\nthe singular solutions for the EPDiff equation and explains why these singular\nsolutions exist (singular momentum map). Then it draws the consequences of\nEPDiff for outline matching problem in CA and gives numerical examples.; Answer: task complete.

Another study detected abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series in the Arctic, indicating increased climate variability in recent decades (Rodionov, 2016). Furthermore, a study found that shorter-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone have contributed to global surface warming, with regional differences in temperature trends (Lu, 2024).\n\nOverall, these studies suggest that climate change is having a profound impact on Arctic ecosystems, leading to changes in sea ice extent, temperature variability, and biodiversity.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to proceed with the next step."}

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

As the name of the course suggests, this\nlecture note introduces readers to a neural network based approach to natural\nlanguage understanding/processing. In order to make it as self-contained as\npossible, I spend much time on describing basics of machine learning and neural\nnetworks, only after which how they are used for natural languages is\nintroduced. On the language front, I almost solely focus on language modelling\nand machine translation, two of which I personally find most fascinating and\nmost fundamental to natural language understanding.\n\nPublished: 2019-07-26\nTitle: Simple Natural Language Processing Tools for Danish\nAuthors: Leon Derczynski\nSummary: This technical note describes a set of baseline tools for automatic\nprocessing of Danish text. The tools are machine-learning based, using natural\nlanguage processing models trained over previously annotated documents. They\nare maintained at ITU Copenhagen and will always be freely available.\n\nPublished: 2021-08-04\nTitle: Curriculum learning for language modeling\nAuthors: Daniel Campos\nSummary: Language Models like ELMo and BERT have provided robust representations of\nnatural language, which serve as the language understanding component for a\ndiverse range of downstream tasks.Curriculum learning is a method that employs\na structured training regime instead, which has been leveraged in computer\nvision and machine translation to improve model training speed and model\nperformance. While language models have proven transformational for the natural\nlanguage processing community, these models have proven expensive,\nenergy-intensive, and challenging to train. In this work, we explore the effect\nof curriculum learning on language model pretraining using various\nlinguistically motivated curricula and evaluate transfer performance on the\nGLUE Benchmark. Despite a broad variety of training methodologies and\nexperiments we do not find compelling evidence that curriculum learning methods\nimprove language model training.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-09-27\nTitle: Network analysis of ballast-mediated species transfer reveals important introduction and dispersal patterns in the Arctic\nAuthors: Mandana Saebi, Jian Xu, Salvatore R. Curasi, Erin K. Grey, Nitesh V. Chawla, David M. Lodge\nSummary: Rapid climate change has wide-ranging implications for the Arctic region,\nincluding sea ice loss, increased geopolitical attention, and expanding\neconomic activity, including a dramatic increase in shipping activity. As a\nresult, the risk of harmful non-native marine species being introduced into\nthis critical region will increase unless policy and management steps are\nimplemented in response. Using big data about shipping, ecoregions, and\nenvironmental conditions, we leverage network analysis and data mining\ntechniques to assess, visualize, and project ballast water-mediated species\nintroductions into the Arctic and dispersal of non-native species within the\nArctic. We first identify high-risk connections between the Arctic and\nnon-Arctic ports that could be sources of non-native species over 15 years\n(1997-2012) and observe the emergence of shipping hubs in the Arctic where the\ncumulative risk of non-native species introduction is increasing. We then\nconsider how environmental conditions can constrain this Arctic introduction\nnetwork for species with different physiological limits, thus providing a\nspecies-level tool for decision-makers. Next, we focus on within-Arctic\nballast-mediated species dispersal where we use higher-order network analysis\nto identify critical shipping routes that may facilitate species dispersal\nwithin the Arctic. The risk assessment and projection framework we propose\ncould inform risk-based assessment and management of ship-borne invasive\nspecies in the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2022-08-15\nTitle: Latent trajectory models for spatio-temporal dynamics in Alaskan ecosystems\nAuthors: Xinyi Lu, Mevin B.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes. Unlike traditional surveys involving closed\nquestions, this novel method offers a fresh perspective on individual\ninterrogations about nature. Running NLP clustering algorithms on a sample of\n3,425 questions, we find that a significant 25.8% inquire about how climate\nchange and biodiversity loss will affect them personally (e.g., where they live\nor vacation, their consumption habits) and the specific impacts of their\nactions on nature (e.g., transportation or food choices). This suggests that\ntraditional methods of surveying may not identify all existing knowledge gaps,\nand that relying solely on IPCC and IPBES reports may not address all\nindividual inquiries about climate and biodiversity, potentially affecting\npublic understanding and action on these issues. *we use \'nature\' as an\numbrella term for \'climate change\' and \'biodiversity loss\'\n\nPublished: 2022-07-17\nTitle: Clustering Future Scenarios Based on Predicted Range Maps\nAuthors: Matthew Davidow, Cory Merow, Judy Che-Castaldo, Toryn Schafer, Marie-Christine Duker, Derek Corcoran, David Matteson\nSummary: Predictions of biodiversity trajectories under climate change are crucial in\norder to act effectively in maintaining the diversity of species. In many\necological applications, future predictions are made under various global\nwarming scenarios as described by a range of different climate models. The\noutputs of these various predictions call for a reliable interpretation. We\npropose a interpretable and flexible two step methodology to measure the\nsimilarity between predicted species range maps and cluster the future scenario\npredictions utilizing a spectral clustering technique. We find that clustering\nbased on ecological impact (predicted species range maps) is mainly ; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society.

A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Chernyavskaya, Ivan Sudakov, Kenneth M. Golden, Leonid A. Timokhov\nSummary: Significant salinity anomalies have been observed in the Arctic Ocean surface\nlayer during the last decade. Using gridded data of winter salinity in the\nupper 50 m layer of the Arctic Ocean for the period 1950-1993 and 2007-2012, we\ninvestigated the inter-annual variability of the salinity fields, attempted to\nidentify patterns and anomalies, and developed a statistical model for the\nprediction of surface layer salinity. The statistical model is based on linear\nregression equations linking the principal components with environmental\nfactors, such as atmospheric circulation, river runoff, ice processes, and\nwater exchange with neighboring oceans. Using this model, we obtained\nprognostic fields of the surface layer salinity for the winter period\n2013-2014. The prognostic fields demonstrated the same tendencies of surface\nlayer freshening that were observed previously. A phase portrait analysis\ninvolving the first two principal components exhibits a dramatic shift in\nbehavior of the 2007-2012 data in comparison to earlier observations.\n\nPublished: 2023-09-26\nTitle: Functional zoning of biodiversity profiles\nAuthors: Natalia Golini, Rosaria Ignaccolo, Luigi Ippoliti, Nicola Pronello\nSummary: Spatial mapping of biodiversity is crucial to investigate spatial variations\nin natural communities. Several indices have been proposed in the literature to\nrepresent biodiversity as a single statistic. However, these indices only\nprovide information on individual dimensions of biodiversity, thus failing to\ngrasp its complexity comprehensively. Consequently, relying solely on these\nsingle indices can lead to misleading conclusions about the actual state of\nbiodiversity. In this work, we focus on biodiversity profiles, which provide a\nmore flexible framework to express biodiversity through non-negative and convex\ncurves, which can be analyzed by means of functional data analysis. By treating\nthe whole curves as single entities, we propose to achieve a functional zoning\nof the region of interest by means of a penalized model-based clustering\nprocedure. This provides a spatial clustering of the biodiversity profiles,\nwhich is useful for policy-makers both for conserving and managing natural\nresources and revealing patterns of interest. Our approach is discussed through\nthe analysis of Harvard Forest Data, which provides information on the spatial\ndistribution of woody stems within a plot of the Harvard Forest.\n\nPublished: 2016-10-22\nTitle: Understanding Sea Ice Melting via Functional Data Analysis\nAuthors: Purba Das, Ananya Lahiri, Sourish Das\nSummary: In this article, we considered the problem of sea ice cover is melting.\nConsidering the `satellite passive microwave remote sensing data\' as functional\ndata, we studied daily observation of sea ice cover of each year as a smooth\ncontinuous function of time. We investigated the mean function for the sea ice\narea for following decades and computed the corresponding $95\\%$ bootstrap\nconfidence interval for the both Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. We found the mean\nfunction for the sea ice area dropped statistically significantly in recent\ndecades for the Arctic Ocean. However, no such statistical evidence was found\nfor the Antarctic ocean. Essentially, the mean function for sea ice area in the\nAntarctic Ocean is unchanged. Additional evidence of the melting of sea ice\narea in the Arctic Ocean is provided by three types of phase curve (namely,\nArea vs. Velocity, Area vs. Acceleration, and Velocity Vs. Acceleration). In\nthe Arctic Ocean, during the summer, the current decades is observing the size\nof the sea ice area about $30\\%$ less, than what it used to be during the first\ndecade.

However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

In many\necological applications, future predictions are made under various global\nwarming scenarios as described by a range of different climate models. The\noutputs of these various predictions call for a reliable interpretation. We\npropose a interpretable and flexible two step methodology to measure the\nsimilarity between predicted species range maps and cluster the future scenario\npredictions utilizing a spectral clustering technique. We find that clustering\nbased on ecological impact (predicted species range maps) is mainly driven by\nthe amount of warming. We contrast this with clustering based only on predicted\nclimate features, which is driven mainly by climate models. The differences\nbetween these clusterings illustrate that it is crucial to incorporate\necological information to understand the relevant differences between climate\nmodels.

While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes. Unlike traditional surveys involving closed\nquestions, this novel method offers a fresh perspective on individual\ninterrogations about nature. Running NLP clustering algorithms on a sample of\n3,425 questions, we find that a significant 25.8% inquire about how climate\nchange and biodiversity loss will affect them personally (e.g., where they live\nor vacation, their consumption habits) and the specific impacts of their\nactions on nature (e.g., transportation or food choices). This suggests that\ntraditional methods of surveying may not identify all existing knowledge gaps,\nand that relying solely on IPCC and IPBES reports may not address all\nindividual inquiries about climate and biodiversity, potentially affecting\npublic understanding and action on these issues. *we use \'nature\' as an\numbrella term for \'climate change\' and \'biodiversity loss\'\n\nPublished: 2008-07-16\nTitle: Spatio-temporal Functional Regression on Paleo-ecological Data\nAuthors: Liliane Bel, Avner Bar-Hen, Rachid Cheddadi, RÃ©my Petit\nSummary: The influence of climate on biodiversity is an important ecological question.\nVarious theories try to link climate change to allelic richness and therefore\nto predict the impact of global warming on genetic diversity.

Psarros, Pantelis A. Dratsas, Stavros A. Papathanassiou\nSummary: Electricity storage is crucial for power systems to achieve higher levels of\nrenewable energy penetration. This is especially significant for\nnon-interconnected island (NII) systems, which are electrically isolated and\nvulnerable to the fluctuations of intermittent renewable generation. This paper\ncomprehensively reviews existing literature on electricity storage in island\nsystems, documenting relevant storage applications worldwide and emphasizing\nthe role of storage in transitioning NII towards a fossil-fuel-independent\nelectricity sector. On this topic, the literature review indicates that the\nimplementation of storage is a prerequisite for attaining renewable penetration\nrates of over 50% due to the amplified requirements for system flexibility and\nrenewable energy arbitrage. The analysis also identifies potential storage\nservices and classifies applicable storage architectures for islands. Amongst\nthe available storage designs, two have emerged as particularly important for\nfurther investigation; standalone, centrally managed storage stations and\nstorage combined with renewables to form a hybrid plant that operates\nindivisibly in the market. For each design, the operating principles,\nremuneration schemes, investment feasibility, and applications discussed in the\nliterature are presented in-depth, while possible implementation barriers are\nacknowledged. The literature on hybrid power plants mainly focuses on\nwind-powered pumped-hydro stations. However, recently, PV-powered battery-based\nhybrid plants have gained momentum due to the decreasing cost of Li-ion\ntechnology. On the other hand, standalone storage establishments rely heavily\non battery technology and are mainly used to provide flexibility to the island\ngrid. Nevertheless, these investments often suffer from insufficient\nremunerating frameworks, making it challenging for storage projects to be\nfinancially secure.\n\nPublished: 2018-06-05\nTitle: On the economics of electrical storage for variable renewable energy sources\nAuthors: Alexander Zerrahn, Wolf-Peter Schill, Claudia Kemfert\nSummary: The use of renewable energy sources is a major strategy to mitigate climate\nchange. Yet Sinn (2017) argues that excessive electrical storage requirements\nlimit the further expansion of variable wind and solar energy. We question, and\nalter, strong implicit assumptions of Sinn\'s approach and find that storage\nneeds are considerably lower, up to two orders of magnitude. First, we move\naway from corner solutions by allowing for combinations of storage and\nrenewable curtailment. Second, we specify a parsimonious optimization model\nthat explicitly considers an economic efficiency perspective.

This study presents an optimisation study of sizing and\noperational strategy parameters of a grid-connected photovoltaic\n(PV)-hydrogen/battery systems using a Multi-Objective Modified Firefly\nAlgorithm (MOMFA). An operational strategy that utilises the ability of\nhydrogen to store energy over a long time was also investigated. The proposed\nmethod was applied to a real-world distributed energy project located in the\ntropical climate zone. To further demonstrate the robustness and versatility of\nthe method, another synthetic test case was examined for a location in the\nsubtropical weather zone, which has a high seas; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2012-09-17\nTitle: Robust seasonal cycle of Arctic sea ice area through tipping point in amplitude\nAuthors: Peter D. Ditlevsen\nSummary: The variation in the Arctic sea ice is dominated by the seasonal cycle with\nlittle inter-annual correlation. Though the mean sea ice area has decreased\nsteadily in the period of satellite observations, a dramatic transition in the\ndynamics was initiated with the record low September ice area in 2007. The\nchange is much more pronounced in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle than in\nthe annual mean ice area. The shape of the seasonal cycle is surprisingly\nconstant for the whole observational record despite the general decline. A\nsimple explanation, independent of the increased greenhouse warming, for the\nshape of the seasonal cycle is offered. Thus the dramatic climate change in\narctic ice area is seen in the amplitude of the cycle and to a lesser extend\nthe annual mean and the summer ice extend. The reason why the climate change is\nmost pronounced in the amplitude is related to the rapid reduction in perennial\nice and thus a thinning of the ice. The analysis shows that a tipping point for\nthe arctic ice area was crossed in 2007.; Answer: task complete.

Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic.

Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices.

In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

The optimal energy management in such\nschemes becomes harder due to the increased complexity and stability\nrequirements, the rapidly varying operating conditions and uncertainty of\nrenewable sources, the conflicting objectives across different timescales, the\nlimited amount of reliable power sources and energy storage. The state of\ncharge management when energy storage is used for multiple services, such as\noptimal scheduling and frequency support, is one of the most notorious problems\nin this context. To address this issue, an optimal energy management system is\nproposed in this paper. It co-optimizes the primary frequency control layer and\nthe dispatch schedule of conventional generators and energy storage by taking\nadvantage of an algorithm that provides adaptive active power demand\nuncertainty quantification, theoretical guarantees for frequency stability, and\nbounds for the reserves for frequency support assigned to the energy storage\nsystem. A convex reformulation is derived enabling the efficient solution of\nthe involved optimization problem, being a test case of an isolated offshore\noil and gas platform presented for validation.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-24\nTitle: Empowering Distributed Solutions in Renewable Energy Systems and Grid Optimization\nAuthors: Mohammad Mohammadi, Ali Mohammadi\nSummary: This study delves into the shift from centralized to decentralized approaches\nin the electricity industry, with a particular focus on how machine learning\n(ML) advancements play a crucial role in empowering renewable energy sources\nand improving grid management.

Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

Psarros, Pantelis A. Dratsas, Stavros A. Papathanassiou\nSummary: Electricity storage is crucial for power systems to achieve higher levels of\nrenewable energy penetration. This is especially significant for\nnon-interconnected island (NII) systems, which are electrically isolated and\nvulnerable to the fluctuations of intermittent renewable generation. This paper\ncomprehensively reviews existing literature on electricity storage in island\nsystems, documenting relevant storage applications worldwide and emphasizing\nthe role of storage in transitioning NII towards a fossil-fuel-independent\nelectricity sector. On this topic, the literature review indicates that the\nimplementation of storage is a prerequisite for attaining renewable penetration\nrates of over 50% due to the amplified requirements for system flexibility and\nrenewable energy arbitrage. The analysis also identifies potential storage\nservices and classifies applicable storage architectures for islands. Amongst\nthe available storage designs, two have emerged as particularly important for\nfurther investigation; standalone, centrally managed storage stations and\nstorage combined with renewables to form a hybrid plant that operates\nindivisibly in the market. For each design, the operating principles,\nremuneration schemes, investment feasibility, and applications discussed in the\nliterature are presented in-depth, while possible implementation barriers are\nacknowledged. The literature on hybrid power plants mainly focuses on\nwind-powered pumped-hydro stations. However, recently, PV-powered battery-based\nhybrid plants have gained momentum due to the decreasing cost of Li-ion\ntechnology. On the other hand, standalone storage establishments rely heavily\non battery technology and are mainly used to provide flexibility to the island\ngrid. Nevertheless, these investments often suffer from insufficient\nremunerating frameworks, making it challenging for storage projects to be\nfinancially secure.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas.

This method,\nwhich is based on the use of pumped-hydro energy storage unit and wind farm\ntogether, increases the profit from the power plant by taking advantage of the\nprice changes in the markets and at the same time supports the power system by\nsupplying a portion of the peak load demand in the system to which the plant is\nconnected. With the objective of examining the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, detailed simulation studies are carried out by making use of actual\nwind and price data, and the results are compared to those obtained for the\nvarious cases in which the storage unit is not available and/or the proposed\nprice-based energy management method is not applied. As a consequence, it is\ndemonstrated that the pumped-hydro energy storage units are the storage systems\ncapable of being used effectively for high-power levels and that the proposed\noptimization problem is quite successful in the cost-effective implementation\nof these systems.\n\nPublished: 2014-03-19\nTitle: Medium-term optimization of pumped hydro storage with stochastic intrastage subproblems\nAuthors: Hubert Abgottspon, GÃ¶ran Andersson\nSummary: This paper presents a medium-term self-scheduling optimization of pumped\nhydro storage power plants with detailed consideration of short-term\nflexibility.

However, due to emphasis on thermal\ngeneration in the current market practices, the flexibility from PSHUs have not\nbeen fully explored and utilized. This paper proposes a configuration based\npumped storage hydro (PSH) model for the day-ahead market, in order to enhance\nthe use of PSH resources in the system. A strategic design of incorporating and\nfully optimizing PSHUs in the day-ahead market is presented. We show the\ncompactness of the proposed model.

Psarros, Pantelis A. Dratsas, Stavros A. Papathanassiou\nSummary: Electricity storage is crucial for power systems to achieve higher levels of\nrenewable energy penetration. This is especially significant for\nnon-interconnected island (NII) systems, which are electrically isolated and\nvulnerable to the fluctuations of intermittent renewable generation. This paper\ncomprehensively reviews existing literature on electricity storage in island\nsystems, documenting relevant storage applications worldwide and emphasizing\nthe role of storage in transitioning NII towards a fossil-fuel-independent\nelectricity sector. On this topic, the literature review indicates that the\nimplementation of storage is a prerequisite for attaining renewable penetration\nrates of over 50% due to the amplified requirements for system flexibility and\nrenewable energy arbitrage. The analysis also identifies potential storage\nservices and classifies applicable storage architectures for islands. Amongst\nthe available storage designs, two have emerged as particularly important for\nfurther investigation; standalone, centrally managed storage stations and\nstorage combined with renewables to form a hybrid plant that operates\nindivisibly in the market. For each design, the operating principles,\nremuneration schemes, investment feasibility, and applications discussed in the\nliterature are presented in-depth, while possible implementation barriers are\nacknowledged. The literature on hybrid power plants mainly focuses on\nwind-powered pumped-hydro stations. However, recently, PV-powered battery-based\nhybrid plants have gained momentum due to the decreasing cost of Li-ion\ntechnology. On the other hand, standalone storage establishments rely heavily\non battery technology and are mainly used to provide flexibility to the island\ngrid. Nevertheless, these investments often suffer from insufficient\nremunerating frameworks, making it challenging for storage projects to be\nfinancially secure.\n\nPublished: 2024-04-09\nTitle: XFLEX HYDRO demonstrators grid services assessment and Ancillary Services Matrix elaboration\nAuthors: Christophe Nicolet, Matthieu Dreyer, Christian Landry, SÃ©bastien AllignÃ©, Antoine BÃ©guin, Yves Vaillant, Stefan Tobler, Goekhan Sari, GrÃ©gory PaÃ¯s, Matteo Bianciotto, Steve Sawyer, Richard Taylor, Manuel Vaz Castro, Maria Helena Vasconcelos, Carlos Moreira\nSummary: This paper presents the methodology and key results which enabled to\nestablish the so-called Ancillary Service Matrix (ASM) presenting the; Answer: task complete.

Y. Chung\nSummary: Compressed air energy storage is suitable for large-scale electrical energy\nstorage, which is important for integrating renewable energy sources into\nelectric power systems. A typical compressed air energy storage plant consists\nof compressors, expanders, caverns, and a motor/generator set. Current cavern\nmodels used for compressed air energy storage are either accurate but highly\nnonlinear or linear but inaccurate. The application of highly nonlinear cavern\nmodels in power system optimization problems renders them computationally\nchallenging to solve. In this regard, an accurate bilinear cavern model for\ncompressed air energy storage is proposed in this paper. The charging and\ndischarging processes in a cavern are divided into several real/virtual states.\nThe first law of thermodynamics and ideal gas law are then utilized to derive a\ncavern model, i.e., a model for the variation of temperature and pressure in\nthese processes. Thereafter, the heat transfer between the air in the cavern\nand the cavern wall is considered and integrated into the cavern model. By\nsubsequently eliminating several negligible terms, the cavern model reduces to\na bilinear model. The accuracy of the bilinear cavern model is verified via\ncomparison with both an accurate nonlinear model and two sets of field-measured\ndata. The bilinear cavern model can be easily linearized and is then suitable\nfor integration into optimization problems considering compressed air energy\nstorage. This is verified via comparatively solving a self-scheduling problem\nof compressed air energy storage using different cavern models.\n\nPublished: 2018-06-18\nTitle: Thermal Energy Grid Storage Using Multijunction Photovoltaics\nAuthors: Caleb Amy, Hamid Reza Seyf, Myles A. Steiner, Daniel J. Friedman, Asegun Henry\nSummary: As the cost of renewable energy falls below fossil fuels, the most important\nchallenge to enable widespread sustainable power generation has become making\nrenewables dispatchable. Low cost energy storage can provide this\ndispatchability, but there is no clear technology that can meet the need.\nPumped hydroelectric and compressed air storage have low costs, but they are\ngeographically constrained. Similarly, lithium-ion batteries are becoming\nubiquitous, but even their lower bounding asymptote cost is too high to enable\ncost-competitive dispatchable renewables. Here, we introduce a concept based on\nthermal energy grid storage (TEGS) using a multijunction photovoltaic heat\nengine (MPV) with promising initial experimental results that could meet the\nlow cost required to enable cost competitive dispatchable renewables. The\napproach exploits an important tradeoff between the accession of an extremely\nlow cost per unit energy stored, by storing heat instead of electricity\ndirectly, while paying the penalty of a lower round trip efficiency. To\nunderstand why this tradeoff is advantageous, we first introduce a framework\nfor evaluating storage technologies that treats round trip efficiency (RTE) as\na variable, in addition to cost per unit energy stored (CPE) and cost per unit\npower (CPP). It is from this perspective that the TEGS-MPV concept offers a\ncompelling economic proposition.\n\nPublished: 2016-01-13\nTitle: A novel flexible and modular energy storage system for near future Energy Banks\nAuthors: Daniele Fargion, Emanuele Habib\nSummary: We considered a novel energy storage system based on the compression of air\nthrough pumped water.

Y. Chung\nSummary: Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is suitable for large-scale energy\nstorage and can help to increase the penetration of wind power in power\nsystems. A CAES plant consists of compressors, expanders, caverns, and a\nmotor/generator set. Currently used cavern models for CAES are either accurate\nbut highly non-linear or linear but inaccurate. Highly non-linear cavern models\ncannot be directly utilized in power system optimization problems.

Thereafter,\nthe heat transfer between the air in the cavern and the cavern wall is\nconsidered and integrated into the cavern model.

However, emerging energy storage\ntechnologies need improvement to compete with lithium-ion batteries and reduce\nthe cost of energy. Identifying and optimizing the the most valuable\nimprovement path of these technologies is challenging due to the non-linearity\nof the energy system model when considering parameters as independent\nvariables. To overcome this, a novel investment-based optimization method is\nproposed. The method involves linear optimization of the hybrid renewable\nenergy system and subsequent investment optimization, accounting for\ndiminishing improvements per investment. Applied to thermal energy, pumped\nthermal energy, molten salt, and adiabatic compressed air energy storage\ntechnologies, the results show that enhancing discharge efficiency is most\nvaluable for all technologies. Reducing discharge capacity costs and energy\nstorage capacity cost can also become important. Charge capacity cost and\ncharge efficiency are found to be of lesser significance. The study provides\ndetailed improvement pathways for each technology under various operational\nconditions, assisting developers in resource allocation. Overall, the\ninvestment-based optimization method and findings contribute to enhancing the\ncompetitiveness of emerging energy storage technologies and reducing reliance\non batteries in renewable energy systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-01-13\nTitle: A novel flexible and modular energy storage system for near future Energy Banks\nAuthors: Daniele Fargion, Emanuele Habib\nSummary: We considered a novel energy storage system based on the compression of air\nthrough pumped water.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X.

Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

El Geneidy, S. Baumeister, M. Peura, J. S. Kotiaho\nSummary: Transformative changes in our production and consumption habits are needed to\nenable the sustainability transition towards carbon neutrality, no net loss of\nbiodiversity, and planetary well-being. Organizations are the way we humans\nhave organized our everyday life, and much of our negative environmental\nimpacts, also called carbon and biodiversity footprints, are caused by\norganizations. Here we show how the financial accounts of any organization can\nbe exploited to develop an integrated carbon and biodiversity footprint\naccount. As a metric we utilize spatially explicit potential global loss of\nspecies which, we argue, can be understood as the biodiversity equivalent, the\nutility of which for biodiversity is similar to what carbon dioxide equivalent\nis for climate. We provide a global Biodiversity Footprint Database that\norganizations, experts and researchers can use to assess consumption-based\nbiodiversity footprints. We also argue that the current integration of\nfinancial and environmental accounting is superficial, and provide a framework\nfor a more robust financial value-transforming accounting model. To test the\nmethodologies, we utilized a Finnish university as a living lab. Assigning an\noffsetting cost to the footprints significantly altered the financial value of\nthe organization. We believe such value-transforming accounting is needed in\norder to draw the attention of senior executives and investors to the negative\nenvironmental impacts of their organizations.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2022-08-15\nTitle: Latent trajectory models for spatio-temporal dynamics in Alaskan ecosystems\nAuthors: Xinyi Lu, Mevin B. Hooten, Ann M. Raiho, David K. Swanson, Carl A. Roland, Sarah E. Stehn\nSummary: The Alaskan landscape has undergone substantial changes in recent decades,\nmost notably the expansion of shrubs and trees across the Arctic. We developed\na dynamic statistical model to quantify the impact of climate change on the\nstructural transformation of ecosystems using remotely sensed imagery. We used\nlatent trajectory processes in a hierarchical framework to model dynamic state\nprobabilities that evolve annually, from which we derived transition\nprobabilities between ecotypes. Our latent trajectory model accommodates\ntemporal irregularity in survey intervals and uses spatio-temporally\nheterogeneous climate drivers to infer rates of land cover transitions. We\ncharacterized multi-scale spatial correlation induced by plot and subplot\narrangement in our study system. We also developed a Polya-Gamma sampling\nstrategy to improve computation. Our model facilitates inference on the\nresponse of ecosystems to shifts in the climate and can be used to predict\nfuture land cover transitions under various climate scenarios.\n\nPublished: 2020-09-27\nTitle: Network analysis of ballast-mediated species transfer reveals important introduction and dispersal patterns in the Arctic\nAuthors: Mandana Saebi, Jian Xu, Salvatore R. Curasi, Erin K. Grey, Nitesh V. Chawla, David M. Lodge\nSummary: Rapid climate change has wide-ranging implications for the Arctic region,\nincluding sea ice loss, increased geopolitical attention, and expanding\neconomic activity, including a dramatic increase in shipping activity. As a\nresult, the risk of harmful non-native marine species being introduced into\nthis critical region will increase unless policy and management steps are\nimplemented in response. Using big data about shipping, ecoregions, and\nenvironmental conditions, we leverage network analysis and data mining\ntechniques to assess, visualize, and project ballast water-mediated species\nintroductions into the Arctic and dispersal of non-native species within the\nArctic. We first identify high-risk connections between the Arctic and\nnon-Arctic ports that could be sources of non-native species over 15 years\n(1997-2012) and observe the emergence of shipping hubs in the Arctic where the\ncumulative risk of non-native species introduction is increasing.

In many\necological applications, future predictions are made under various global\nwarming scenarios as described by a range of different climate models. The\noutputs of these various predictions call for a reliable interpretation. We\npropose a interpretable and flexible two step methodology to measure the\nsimilarity between predicted species range maps and cluster the future scenario\npredictions utilizing a spectral clustering technique. We find that clustering\nbased on ecological impact (predicted species range maps) is mainly driven by\nthe amount of warming. We contrast this with clustering based only on predicted\nclimate features, which is driven mainly by climate models. The differences\nbetween these clusterings illustrate that it is crucial to incorporate\necological information to understand the relevant differences between climate\nmodels. The findings of this work can be used to better synthesize forecasts of\nbiodiversity loss under the wide spectrum of results that emerge when\nconsidering potential future biodiversity loss.\n\nPublished: 2023-09-25\nTitle: Value-transforming financial, carbon and biodiversity footprint accounting\nAuthors: S. El Geneidy, S. Baumeister, M. Peura, J. S. Kotiaho\nSummary: Transformative changes in our production and consumption habits are needed to\nenable the sustainability transition towards carbon neutrality, no net loss of\nbiodiversity, and planetary well-being. Organizations are the way we humans\nhave organized our everyday life, and much of our negative environmental\nimpacts, also called carbon and biodiversity footprints, are caused by\norganizations. Here we show how the financial accounts of any organization can\nbe exploited to develop an integrated carbon and biodiversity footprint\naccount. As a metric we utilize spatially explicit potential global loss of\nspecies which, we argue, can be understood as the biodiversity equivalent, the\nutility of which for biodiversity is similar to what carbon dioxide equivalent\nis for climate. We provide a global Biodiversity Footprint Database that\norganizations, experts and researchers can use to assess consumption-based\nbiodiversity footprints. We also argue that the current integration of\nfinancial and environmental accounting is superficial, and provide a framework\nfor a more robust financial value-transforming accounting model. To test the\nmethodologies, we utilized a Finnish university as a living lab. Assigning an\noffsetting cost to the footprints significantly altered the financial value of\nthe organization. We believe such value-transforming accounting is needed in\norder to draw the attention of senior executives and investors to the negative\nenvironmental impacts of their organizations.\n\nPublished: 2024-07-18\nTitle: Tree semantic segmentation from aerial image time series\nAuthors: Venkatesh Ramesh, Arthur Ouaknine, David Rolnick\nSummary: Earth\'s forests play an important role in the fight against climate change,\nand are in turn negatively affected by it. Effective monitoring of different\ntree species is essential to understanding and improving the health and\nbiodiversity of forests. In this work, we address the challenge of tree species\nidentification by performing semantic segmentation of trees using an aerial\nimage dataset spanning over a year. We compare models trained on single images\nversus those trained on time series to assess the impact of tree phenology on\nsegmentation performances. We also introduce a simple convolutional block for\nextracting spatio-temporal features from image time series, enabling the use of\npopular pretrained backbones and methods.

Of\nparticular interest are wetlands, a type of ecosystem that constitutes the most\neffective terrestrial long-term carbon store. As permafrost thaws, the carbon\nthat was locked in these wetland soils for millennia becomes available for\naerobic and anaerobic decomposition, which releases CO2 and CH4, respectively,\nback to the atmosphere.As CO2 and CH4 are potent greenhouse gases, this\ntransfer of carbon from the land to the atmosphere further contributes to\nglobal warming, thereby increasing the rate of permafrost degradation in a\npositive feedback loop. Therefore, monitoring Arctic wetland health and\ndynamics is a key scientific task that is also of importance for policy.\nHowever, the identification and delineation of these important wetland\necosystems, remain incomplete and often inaccurate. Mapping the extent of\nArctic wetlands remains a challenge for the scientific community. Conventional,\ncoarser remote sensing methods are inadequate at distinguishing the diverse and\nmicro-topographically complex non-vascular vegetation that characterize Arctic\nwetlands, presenting the need for better identification methods. To tackle this\nchallenging problem, we constructed and annotated the first-of-its-kind Arctic\nWetland Dataset (AWD). Based on that, we present ArcticNet, a deep neural\nnetwork that exploits the multi-spectral, high-resolution imagery captured from\nnanosatellites (Planet Dove CubeSats) with additional DEM from the ArcticDEM\nproject, to semantically label a Arctic study area into six types, in which\nthree Arctic wetland functional types are included. We present multi-fold\nefforts to handle the arising challenges, including class imbalance, and the\nchoice of fusion strategies. Preliminary results endorse the high promise of\nArcticNet, achieving 93.12% in labelling a hold-out set of regions in our\nArctic study area.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes. Unlike traditional surveys involving closed\nquestions, this novel method offers a fresh perspective on individual\ninterrogations about nature. Running NLP clustering algorithms on a sample of\n3,425 questions, we find that a significant 25.8% inquire about how climate\nchange and biodiversity loss will affect them personally (e.g., where they live\nor vacation, their consumption habits) and the specific impacts of their\nactions on nature (e.g., transportation or food choices). This suggests that\ntraditional methods of surveying may not identify all existing knowledge gaps,\nand that relying solely on IPCC and IPBES reports may not address all\nindividual inquiries about climate and biodiversity, potentially affecting\npublic understanding and action on these issues. *we use \'nature\' as an\numbrella term for \'climate change\' and \'biodiversity loss\'\n\nPublished: 2020-09-27\nTitle: Network analysis of ballast-mediated species transfer reveals important introduction and dispersal patterns in the Arctic\nAuthors: Mandana Saebi, Jian Xu, Salvatore R.

The\nfindings highlight the significant advantage of incorporating experimental data\nover relying solely on simulated data for enhancing the accuracy of machine\nlearning predictions in the field of MOF research.\n\nPublished: 2011-07-28\nTitle: NEMO: Extraction and normalization of organization names from PubMed affiliation strings\nAuthors: Siddhartha Jonnalagadda, Philip Topham\nSummary: We propose NEMO, a system for extracting organization names in the\naffiliation and normalizing them to a canonical organization name. Our parsing\nprocess involves multi-layered rule matching with multiple dictionaries. The\nsystem achieves more than 98% f-score in extracting organization names. Our\nprocess of normalization that involves clustering based on local sequence\nalignment metrics and local learning based on finding connected components. A\nhigh precision was also observed in normalization. NEMO is the missing link in\nassociating each biomedical paper and its authors to an organization name in\nits canonical form and the Geopolitical location of the organization. This\nresearch could potentially help in analyzing large social networks of\norganizations for landscaping a particular topic, improving performance of\nauthor disambiguation, adding weak links in the co-author network of authors,\naugmenting NLM\'s MARS system for correcting errors in OCR output of affiliation\nfield, and automatically indexing the PubMed citations with the normalized\norganization name and country.

For SNA of\na particular disease area, we need to identify the key research groups in that\narea by mining the affiliation information from PubMed. This not only involves\nrecognizing the organization names in the affiliation string, but also\nresolving ambiguities to identify the article with a unique organization. We\npresent here a process of normalization that involves clustering based on local\nsequence alignment metrics and local learning based on finding connected\ncomponents. We demonstrate the application of the method by analyzing\norganizations involved in angiogenensis treatment, and demonstrating the\nutility of the results for researchers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology\nindustries or national funding agencies.; Answer: task complete.

As sea ice continues\nto decline due to climate change, it has become imperative to accurately\npredict the future of sea ice extent (SIE). Using datasets of Arctic\nmeteorological and SIE variables spanning 1979 to 2021, we propose\narchitectures capable of processing multivariate time series and spatiotemporal\ndata. Our proposed framework consists of ensembled stacked Fourier Transform\nsignals (FFTstack) and Gradient Boosting models. In FFTstack, grid search\niteratively detects the optimal combination of representative FFT signals, a\nprocess that improves upon current FFT implementations and deseasonalizers. An\noptimized Gradient Boosting Regressor is then trained on the residual of the\nFFTstack output. Through experiment, we found that the models trained on both\nmultivariate and spatiotemporal time series data performed either similar to or\nbetter than models in existing research. In addition, we found that integration\nof FFTstack improves the performance of current multivariate time series\nmodels. We conclude that the high flexibility and performance of this\nmethodology have promising applications in guiding future adaptation,\nresilience, and mitigation efforts in response to Arctic sea ice retreat.\n\nPublished: 2022-12-20\nTitle: An approach for projecting the timing of abrupt winter Arctic sea ice loss\nAuthors: Camille Hankel, Eli Tziperman\nSummary: Abrupt and irreversible winter Arctic sea-ice loss may occur under\nanthropogenic warming due to the collapse of a sea-ice equilibrium at a\nthreshold value of CO$_2$, commonly referred to as a tipping point. Previous\nwork has been unable to conclusively identify whether a tipping point in Arctic\nsea ice exists because fully-coupled climate models are too computationally\nexpensive to run to equilibrium for many CO$_2$ values. Here, we explore the\ndeviation of sea ice from its equilibrium state under realistic rates of CO$_2$\nincrease to demonstrate how a few time-dependent CO$_2$ experiments can be used\nto predict the existence and timing of sea-ice tipping points without running\nthe model to steady-state. This study highlights the inefficacy of using a\nsingle experiment with slow-changing CO$_2$ to discover changes in the sea-ice\nsteady-state, and provides an alternate method that can be developed for the\nidentification of tipping points in realistic climate models.\n\nPublished: 2017-12-04\nTitle: Gaussian Process Regression for Arctic Coastal Erosion Forecasting\nAuthors: Matthew Kupilik, Frank Witmer, Euan-Angus MacLeod, Caixia Wang, Tom Ravens\nSummary: Arctic coastal morphology is governed by multiple factors, many of which are\naffected by climatological changes. As the season length for shorefast ice\ndecreases and temperatures warm permafrost soils, coastlines are more\nsusceptible to erosion from storm waves. Such coastal erosion is a concern,\nsince the majority of the population centers and infrastructure in the Arctic\nare located near the coasts. Stakeholders and decision makers increasingly need\nmodels capable of scenario-based predictions to assess and mitigate the effects\nof coastal morphology on infrastructure and land use. Our research uses\nGaussian process models to forecast Arctic coastal erosion along the Beaufort\nSea near Drew Point, AK. Gaussian process regression is a data-driven modeling\nmethodology capable of extracting patterns and trends from data-sparse\nenvironments such as remote Arctic coastlines. To train our model, we use\nannual coastline positions and near-shore summer temperature averages from\nexisting datasets and extend these data by extracting additional coastlines\nfrom satellite imagery. We combine our calibrated models with future climate\nmodels to generate a r; Answer: task complete.

Yet Sinn (2017) argues that excessive electrical storage requirements\nlimit the further expansion of variable wind and solar energy. We question, and\nalter, strong implicit assumptions of Sinn\'s approach and find that storage\nneeds are considerably lower, up to two orders of magnitude. First, we move\naway from corner solutions by allowing for combinations of storage and\nrenewable curtailment.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-04\nTitle: Optimal Sizing of On-site Renewable Resources for Offshore Microgrids\nAuthors: Ann Mary Toms, Xingpeng Li, Kaushik Rajashekara\nSummary: The offshore oil and natural gas platforms, mostly powered by diesel or gas\ngenerators, consume approximately 16TWh of electricity worldwide per year,\nwhich emits large amount of CO2. To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.; Answer: task complete.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2020-09-27\nTitle: Network analysis of ballast-mediated species transfer reveals important introduction and dispersal patterns in the Arctic\nAuthors: Mandana Saebi, Jian Xu, Salvatore R. Curasi, Erin K. Grey, Nitesh V. Chawla, David M. Lodge\nSummary: Rapid climate change has wide-ranging implications for the Arctic region,\nincluding sea ice loss, increased geopolitical attention, and expanding\neconomic activity, including a dramatic increase in shipping activity. As a\nresult, the risk of harmful non-native marine species being introduced into\nthis critical region will increase unless policy and management steps are\nimplemented in response. Using big data about shipping, ecoregions, and\nenvironmental conditions, we leverage network analysis and data mining\ntechniques to assess, visualize, and project ballast water-mediated species\nintroductions into the Arctic and dispersal of non-native species within the\nArctic. We first identify high-risk connections between the Arctic and\nnon-Arctic ports that could be sources of non-native species over 15 years\n(1997-2012) and observe the emergence of shipping hubs in the Arctic where the\ncumulative risk of non-native species introduction is increasing. We then\nconsider how environmental conditions can constrain this Arctic introduction\nnetwork for species with different physiological limits, thus providing a\nspecies-level tool for decision-makers. Next, we focus on within-Arctic\nballast-mediated species dispersal where we use higher-order network analysis\nto identify critical shipping routes that may facilitate species dispersal\nwithin the Arctic. The risk assessment and projection framework we propose\ncould inform risk-based assessment and management of ship-borne invasive\nspecies in the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2022-01-13\nTitle: Deep Learning-based Extreme Heatwave Forecast\nAuthors: ValÃ©rian Jacques-Dumas, Francesco Ragone, Pierre Borgnat, Patrice Abry, Freddy Bouchet\nSummary: Because of the impact of extreme heat waves and heat domes on society and\nbiodiversity, their study is a key challenge. We specifically study\nlong-lasting extreme heat waves, which are among the most important for climate\nimpacts. Physics driven weather forecast systems or climate models can be used\nto forecast their occurrence or predict their probability. The present work\nexplores the use of deep learning architectures, trained using outputs of a\nclimate model, as an alternative strategy to forecast the occurrence of extreme\nlong-lasting heatwaves. This new approach will be useful for several key\nscientific goals which include the study of climate model statistics, building\na quantitative proxy for resampling rare events in climate models, study the\nimpact of climate change, and should eventually be useful for forecasting.\nFulfilling these important goals implies addressing issues such as class-size\nimbalance that is intrinsically asso; Answer: task complete.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.
