Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

At the current rate, quantum computers are\ngrowing in size rapidly backed up by the increase of research in the field.\nSignificant efforts are being made to improve the reliability of quantum\nhardware and to develop suitable software to program quantum computers. In\ncontrast, the verification of quantum programs has received relatively less\nattention. Verifying programs is especially important in the quantum setting\ndue to how difficult it is to program complex algorithms correctly on\nresource-constrained and error-prone quantum hardware. Research into creating\nverification frameworks for quantum programs has seen recent development, with\na variety of tools implemented using a collection of theoretical ideas. This\nsurvey aims to be a short introduction into the area of formal verification of\nquantum programs, bringing together theory and tools developed to date.\nFurther, this survey examines some of the challenges that the field may face in\nthe future, namely the development of complex quantum algorithms.\n\nPublished: 2022-10-31\nTitle: Quantum Computers for Weather and Climate Prediction: The Good, the Bad and the Noisy\nAuthors: Felix Tennie, Tim Palmer\nSummary: Over the past few years, quantum computers and quantum algorithms have\nattracted considerable interest and attention from numerous scientific\ndisciplines. In this article, we aim to provide a non-technical, yet\ninformative introduction to key aspects of quantum computing. We discuss\nwhether quantum computers one day might become useful tools for numerical\nweather and climate prediction. Using a recently developed quantum algorithm\nfor solving non-linear differential equations, we integrate a simple non-linear\nmodel. In addition to considering the advantages that quantum computers have to\noffer, we shall also discuss the challenges one faces when trying to use\nquantum computers for real-world problems involving \'\'big data\'\', such as\nweather prediction.\n\nPublished: 2005-09-28\nTitle: Nondeterministic testing of Sequential Quantum Logic propositions on a quantum computer\nAuthors: M. S. Leifer\nSummary: In the past few years it has been shown that universal quantum computation\ncan be obtained by projective measurements alone, with no need for unitary\ngates. This suggests that the underlying logic of quantum computing may be an\nalgebra of sequences of quantum measurements rather than an algebra of products\nof unitary operators. Such a Sequential Quantum Logic (SQL) was developed in\nthe late 70\'s and has more recently been applied to the consistent histories\nframework of quantum mechanics as a possible route to the theory of quantum\ngravity. In this letter, I give a method for deciding the truth of a\nproposition in SQL with nonzero probability of success on a quantum computer.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

However, given the\nvariability of the renewables as well as the energy demand, it is imperative to\ndevelop effective control and energy storage schemes to manage the variable\nenergy generation and achieve desired system economics and environmental goals.\nIn this paper, we introduce a hybrid energy storage system composed of battery\nand hydrogen energy storage to handle the uncertainties related to electricity\nprices, renewable energy production and consumption. We aim to improve\nrenewable energy utilisation and minimise energy costs and carbon emissions\nwhile ensuring energy reliability and stability within the network. To achieve\nthis, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient approach,\nwhich is a deep reinforcement learning-based control strategy to optimise the\nscheduling of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand in real-time.\nThe proposed approach is model-free and does not require explicit knowledge and\nrigorous mathematical models of the smart energy network environment.\nSimulation results based on real-world data show that: (i) integration and\noptimised operation of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand\nreduces carbon emissions by 78.69%, improves cost savings by 23.5% and\nrenewable energy utilisation by over 13.2% compared to other baseline models\nand (ii) the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art self-learning\nalgorithms like deep-Q network.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-22\nTitle: Direct and Indirect Hydrogen Storage: Dynamics and Interactions in the Transition to a Renewable Energy Based System for Europe\nAuthors: Zhiyuan Xie, Gorm Bruun Andresen\nSummary: To move towards a low-carbon society by 2050, understanding the intricate\ndynamics of energy systems is critical. Our study examines these interactions\nthrough the lens of hydrogen storage, dividing it into \'direct\' and \'indirect\'\nhydrogen storage. Direct hydrogen storage involves electrolysis-produced\nhydrogen being stored before use, while indirect storage first transforms\nhydrogen into gas via the Sabatier process for later energy distribution.\nFirstly, we utilize the PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30-path model to capture the interactions\nwithin the energy system. The model is an hour-level, one node per country\nsystem that encompasses a range of energy transformation technologies,\noutlining a pathway for Europe to reduce carbon emissions by 95 percent by 2050\ncompared to 1990, with updates every 5 years. Subsequently, we employ both\nquantitative and qualitative approaches to thoroughly analyze these complex\nrelationships. Our research indicates that during the European green\ntransition, cross-country flow of electricity will play an important role in\nEurope\'s rapid decarbonization stage before the large-scale introduction of\nenergy storage. Under the paper cost assumptions, fuel cells are not considered\na viable option. This research further identifies the significant impact of\nnatural resource variability on the local energy mix, highlighting indirect\nhydrogen storage as a common solution due to the better economic performance\nand actively fluctuation pattern. Specifically, indirect hydrogen storage will\ncontribute at least 60 percent of hydrogen storage benefits, reaching 100\npercent in Italy. Moreover, its fluctuation pattern will change with the local\nenergy structure, which is a distinct difference with the unchanged pattern of\ndirect hydrogen storage and battery storage.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thu; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.; Answer: task complete.

Nowadays\ncomputers are absolutely essential for the music economy. Thus, it is very\nlikely that quantum computers will impact the music industry in time to come.\nThis chapter lays the foundations of the new field of \'Quantum Computer Music\'.\nIt begins with an introduction to algorithmic computer music and methods to\nprogram computers to generate music, such as Markov chains and random walks.\nThen, it presents quantum computing versions of those methods. The discussions\nare supported by detailed explanations of quantum computing concepts and\nwalk-through examples. A bespoke generative music algorithm is presented, the\nBasak-Miranda algorithm, which leverages a property of quantum mechanics known\nas constructive and destructive interference to operate a musical Markov chain.\nAn Appendix introducing the fundamentals of quantum computing deemed necessary\nto understand the chapter and a link to access Jupyter Notebooks with examples\nare also provided.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-19\nTitle: Birkhoff style proof systems for hybrid-dynamic quantum logic\nAuthors: Daniel Gaina\nSummary: We explore a simple approach to quantum logic based on hybrid and dynamic\nmodal logic, where the set of states is given by some Hilbert space.

In this paper, we refine and advance\nthe previous theory in this area providing a more rigorous formulation for the\ncomposable key rate of a generic CV-QKD protocol.

We study cost-optimal\nhighly-renewable Chinese power systems under ambitious CO$ _2 $ emission\nreduction targets, by deploying a 31-node hourly-resolved techno-economic\noptimization model supported by a validated weather-converted 38-year-long\nrenewable power generation and electricity demand dataset. With a new realistic\nreservoir hydro model, we find that if CO$_2$ emission reduction goes beyond\n70\\%, storage facilities such as hydro, battery and hydrogen become necessary\nfor a moderate system cost. Numerical results show that these flexibility\ncomponents can lower renewable curtailment by two thirds, allow higher solar PV\nshare by a factor of two and contribute to covering summer cooling demand. We\nshow that expanding unidirectional high-voltage DC lines on top of the regional\ninter-connections is technically sufficient and more economical than\nultra-high-voltage-AC-connected "One-Net" grid. Finally, constraining\ntransmission volume from the optimum by up to 25\\% does not push total costs\nmuch higher, while the significant need for battery storage remains even with\nabundant interconnectivity.\n\nPublished: 2021-09-17\nTitle: 100% renewable electricity in Japan\nAuthors: Cheng Cheng, Andrew Blakers, Matthew Stocks, Bin Lu\nSummary: Japan has committed to carbon neutrality by 2050. Emissions from the\nelectricity sector amount to 42% of the total. Solar photovoltaics (PV) and\nwind comprise three quarters of global net capacity additions because of low\nand falling prices. This provides an opportunity for Japan to make large\nreductions in emissions while also reducing its dependence on energy imports.\nThis study shows that Japan has 14 times more solar and offshore wind resources\nthan needed to supply 100% renewable electricity. A 40 year hourly energy\nbalance model is presented of Japan\'s electricity system using historical data.\nPumped hydro energy storage, high voltage interconnection and dispatchable\ncapacity (hydro, biomass and hydrogen energy) are included to balance variable\ngeneration and demand. Differential evolution is used to find the least-cost\nsolution under various constraints. The levelized cost of electricity is found\nto be USD 86 per MWh for a PV-dominated system, and USD 110 per MWh for a\nwind-dominated system. These costs can be compared with the average system\nprices on the spot market in Japan of USD 102 per MWh. In summary, Japan can be\nself-sufficient for electricity supply at competitive costs.\n\nPublished: 2019-01-14\nTitle: A validated high-resolution hydro power time-series model for energy systems analysis\nAuthors: Hailiang Liu, Gorm Bruun Andresen, Tom Brown, Martin Greiner\nSummary: We expand the renewable technology model palette and present a validated high\nresolution hydro power time series model for energy systems analysis.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-12-04\nTitle: Efficient Social Distancing for COVID-19: An Integration of Economic Health and Public Health\nAuthors: Kexin Chen, Chi Seng Pun, Hoi Ying Wong\nSummary: Social distancing has been the only effective way to contain the spread of an\ninfectious disease prior to the availability of the pharmaceutical treatment.\nIt can lower the infection rate of the disease at the economic cost. A pandemic\ncrisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a\nlong-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic\ncost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to\nmanage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for\nCOVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The\nsocial distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently\naccessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community\nmobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven\neconomic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the\nsearch of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control\nproblem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach. By\napplying our framework to the US data, we empirically examine the efficiency of\nthe US social distancing policy and offer recommendations generated from the\nalgorithm.\n\nPublished: 2022-01-15\nTitle: Vaccination strategies and transmission of COVID-19: evidence across advanced countries\nAuthors: Dongwoo Kim, Young Jun Lee\nSummary: Given limited supply of approved vaccines and constrained medical resources,\ndesign of a vaccination strategy to control a pandemic is an economic problem.\nWe use time-series and panel methods with real-world country-level data to\nestimate effects on COVID-19 cases and deaths of two key elements of mass\nvaccination - time between doses and vaccine type. We find that new infections\nand deaths are both significantly negatively associated with the fraction of\nthe population vaccinated with at least one dose. Conditional on first-dose\ncoverage, an increased fraction with two doses appears to offer no further\nreductions in new cases and deaths. For vaccines from China, however, we find\nsignificant effects on both health outcomes only after two doses. Our results\nsupport a policy of extending the interval between first and second doses of\nvaccines developed in Europe and the US. As vaccination progresses, population\nmobility increases, which partially offsets the direct effects of vaccination.\nThi; Answer: task complete.

Curasi, Erin K. Grey, Nitesh V. Chawla, David M. Lodge\nSummary: Rapid climate change has wide-ranging implications for the Arctic region,\nincluding sea ice loss, increased geopolitical attention, and expanding\neconomic activity, including a dramatic increase in shipping activity. As a\nresult, the risk of harmful non-native marine species being introduced into\nthis critical region will increase unless policy and management steps are\nimplemented in response. Using big data about shipping, ecoregions, and\nenvironmental conditions, we leverage network analysis and data mining\ntechniques to assess, visualize, and project ballast water-mediated species\nintroductions into the Arctic and dispersal of non-native species within the\nArctic. We first identify high-risk connections between the Arctic and\nnon-Arctic ports that could be sources of non-native species over 15 years\n(1997-2012) and observe the emergence of shipping hubs in the Arctic where the\ncumulative risk of non-native species introduction is increasing. We then\nconsider how environmental conditions can constrain this Arctic introduction\nnetwork for species with different physiological limits, thus providing a\nspecies-level tool for decision-makers. Next, we focus on within-Arctic\nballast-mediated species dispersal where we use higher-order network analysis\nto identify critical shipping routes that may facilitate species dispersal\nwithin the Arctic. The risk assessment and projection framework we propose\ncould inform risk-based assessment and management of ship-borne invasive\nspecies in the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X.

However, given the\nvariability of the renewables as well as the energy demand, it is imperative to\ndevelop effective control and energy storage schemes to manage the variable\nenergy generation and achieve desired system economics and environmental goals.\nIn this paper, we introduce a hybrid energy storage system composed of battery\nand hydrogen energy storage to handle the uncertainties related to electricity\nprices, renewable energy production and consumption. We aim to improve\nrenewable energy utilisation and minimise energy costs and carbon emissions\nwhile ensuring energy reliability and stability within the network. To achieve\nthis, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient approach,\nwhich is a deep reinforcement learning-based control strategy to optimise the\nscheduling of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand in real-time.\nThe proposed approach is model-free and does not require explicit knowledge and\nrigorous mathematical models of the smart energy network environment.\nSimulation results based on real-world data show that: (i) integration and\noptimised operation of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand\nreduces carbon emissions by 78.69%, improves cost savings by 23.5% and\nrenewable energy utilisation by over 13.2% compared to other baseline models\nand (ii) the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art self-learning\nalgorithms like deep-Q network.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-05\nTitle: A full-time scale energy management and battery size optimization for off-grid renewable power to hydrogen systems: A battery energy storage-based grid-forming case in Inner Mongolian\nAuthors: Jie Zhu\nSummary: Hydrogen plays an important role in the context of global carbon reduction.\nFor an off-grid renewable power to hydrogen system (OReP2HS), a grid-forming\n(GFM) source is essential to provide frequency and voltage references. Here, we\ntake battery works as a GFM source, and the OReP2HS we focus on is comprised of\nsolar photovoltaic, wind turbines, and alkaline electrolyzers for hydrogen\ngeneration. An elaborative full-time scale energy management strategy (EMS)\ncovers GFM control to system scheduling (from milliseconds to hours) and is\nproposed to support high-precision production simulations. Loads of\nelectrolysers are designed to track the renewable power closely to partly\nreplace the energy balancing requirement of the battery. A continuous operation\nstrategy during an emergency like a unit drop is also included in the presented\nEMS. An off-line simulation-based iterative searching algorithm is developed to\nfind the most suitable size of the battery with the minimum levelized cost of\nhydrogen (LCOH). A practical OReP2H project located in Inner Mongolian, China\nis taken as a case study. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the\nproposed method, and the optimized capacity of the battery (3.4MWh) only\naccounts for 13.6% of the total installed capacity of the sources with the\nproposed EMS. Sensitivity analysis shows that LOCH rises from 28.829 CYN/kg to\n37.814 CYN/kg, with the time-step for fast power regulation of electrolysers\nchanging from 4s to 1 min with a ramp rate of 0.05MW/s.\n\nPublished: 2019-02-15\nTitle: The role of hydro power, storage and transmission in the decarbonization of the Chinese power system\nAuthors: Hailiang Liu, Tom Brown, Gorm Bruun Andresen, David P.

Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Renewable\nenergy has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions, while higher\npenetration of renewable energy is hindered by the inherent variability and\nintermittency of renewable resources. This motivates the development of\nmicrogrids supplied by renewable energy resources. With proper control of\nstorage units and communications with the energy market, the non-dispatchable\nenergy can be regulated to reduce the difficulty of power scheduling in the\ngrid operation. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are widely used to make\nrenewable energy more controllable and usable on demand. With suitable\nprediction techniques and control algorithms, BESS can store part of the\ngenerated renewable energy and supply some stored energy at different periods,\nso that the actual power dispatched can meet the required operating criteria.\nThe control algorithms introduced in this report are developed to maximize the\nprofit and minimize the energy cost in microgrids, which require predicted data\non renewable power, temperature, electricity price, and load demand.\n\nPublished: 2010-06-02\nTitle: Locating PHEV Exchange Stations in V2G\nAuthors: Feng Pan, Russell Bent, Alan Berscheid, David Izraelevitz\nSummary: Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are an environmentally friendly\ntechnology that is expected to rapidly penetrate the transportation system.\nRenewable energy sources such as wind and solar have received considerable\nattention as clean power options for future generation expansion. However,\nthese sources are intermittent and increase the uncertainty in the ability to\ngenerate power. The deployment of PHEVs in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system\nprovide a potential mechanism for reducing the variability of renewable energy\nsources. For example, PHEV supporting infrastructures like battery exchange\nstations that provide battery service to PHEV customers could be used as\nstorage devices to stabilize the grid when renewable energy production is\nfluctuating. In this paper, we study how to best site these stations in terms\nof how they can support both the transportation system and the power grid. To\nmodel this problem we develop a two-stage stochastic program to optimally\nlocate the stations prior to the realization of battery demands, loads, and\ngeneration capacity of renewable power sources. We develop two test cases to\nstudy the benefits and the performance of these systems.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of; Answer: task complete.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

Whether global warming will continue even in the\nfuture, is a question that is most important to investigate. In this regard,\nthe so-called general circulation models (GCMs) have attempted to project the\nfuture climate, and nearly all of them exhibit alarming rates of global\ntemperature rise in the future.\n  Although global warming in the current time frame is undeniable, it is\nimportant to assess the validity of the future predictions of the GCMs. In this\narticle, we attempt such a study using our recently-developed Bayesian multiple\ntesting paradigm for model selection in inverse regression problems. The model\nwe assume for the global temperature time series is based on Gaussian process\nemulation of the black box scenario, realistically treating the dynamic\nevolution of the time series as unknown.\n  We apply our ideas to datasets available from the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) website. The best GCM models selected by our method under\ndifferent assumptions on future climate change scenarios do not convincingly\nsupport the present global warming pattern when only the future predictions are\nconsidered known. Using our Gaussian process idea, we also forecast the future\ntemperature time series given the current one. Interestingly, our results do\nnot support drastic future global warming predicted by almost all the GCM\nmodels.\n\nPublished: 2018-07-04\nTitle: Climate network percolation reveals the expansion and weakening of the tropical component under global warming\nAuthors: Jingfang Fan, Jun Meng, Yosef Ashkenazy, Shlomo Havlin, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber\nSummary: Global climate warming poses a significant challenge to humanity; it is\nassociated with, e.g., rising sea level and declining Arctic sea ice.\nIncreasing extreme events are also considered to be a result of climate\nwarming~\\cite{pachauri2014climate,ogorman_contrasting_2014} and they may have\nwidespread and diverse effects on health, agriculture, economics and political\nconflicts\n\\cite{hsiang2011civil,helbing_globally_2013,schleussner_armed-conflict_2016,carleton_social_2016}.\nStill, the detection and quantification of climate change, both in observations\nand climate models, constitute a main focus of the scientific community. Here\nwe develop a new approach based on network and percolation frameworks\n\\cite{cohen2010complex} to study the impacts of climate changes in the past\ndecades using historical models and reanalysis records, and we analyze the\nexpected upcoming impacts using various future global warming scenarios. More\nspecifically, we classify the globe area into evolving percolation clusters and\nfind a discontinuous phase transition, which indicates a consistent poleward\nexpansion of the largest (tropical) cluster, as well as the weakening of the\nlink\'s strength. This is found both in the reanalysis data and in the Coupled\nModel Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) twenty-first century climate\nchange simulations~\\cite{taylor2012overview}. The analysis is based on high\nresolution surface (2~m) air temperature field records. We discuss the\nunderlying mechanism for the observed expansion of the tropical cluster and\nassociate it with changes in atmospheric circulation represented by the\nweakening and expansion of the Hadley cell. Our framework can also be useful\nfor forecasting the extent of the tropical cluster in order to detect its\ninfluence on different areas in response to global warming.\n\nPublished: 2023-05-09\nTitle: Impact of Changing Greenhouse Gas Concentrations on Ontario\'s Climate\nAuthors: W.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X.

Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

COVID-19 poses a significant challenge to US stock traders and\ninvestors. Traders and investors should keep up with the stock market. This is\nto mitigate risks and improve profits by using forecasting models that account\nfor the effects of the pandemic. With consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic\nafter the recession, two machine learning models, including Random Forest and\nLSTM are used to forecast two major US stock market indices. Data on historical\nprices after the big recession is used for developing machine learning models\nand forecasting index returns. To evaluate the model performance during\ntraining, cross-validation is used. Additionally, hyperparameter optimizing,\nregularization, such as dropouts and weight decays, and preprocessing improve\nthe performances of Machine Learning techniques. Using high-accuracy machine\nlearning techniques, traders and investors can forecast stock market behavior,\nstay ahead of their competition, and improve profitability.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.; Answer: task complete.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Psarros, Pantelis A. Dratsas, Stavros A. Papathanassiou\nSummary: Electricity storage is crucial for power systems to achieve higher levels of\nrenewable energy penetration. This is especially significant for\nnon-interconnected island (NII) systems, which are electrically isolated and\nvulnerable to the fluctuations of intermittent renewable generation. This paper\ncomprehensively reviews existing literature on electricity storage in island\nsystems, documenting relevant storage applications worldwide and emphasizing\nthe role of storage in transitioning NII towards a fossil-fuel-independent\nelectricity sector. On this topic, the literature review indicates that the\nimplementation of storage is a prerequisite for attaining renewable penetration\nrates of over 50% due to the amplified requirements for system flexibility and\nrenewable energy arbitrage. The analysis also identifies potential storage\nservices and classifies applicable storage architectures for islands. Amongst\nthe available storage designs, two have emerged as particularly important for\nfurther investigation; standalone, centrally managed storage stations and\nstorage combined with renewables to form a hybrid plant that operates\nindivisibly in the market. For each design, the operating principles,\nremuneration schemes, investment feasibility, and applications discussed in the\nliterature are presented in-depth, while possible implementation barriers are\nacknowledged. The literature on hybrid power plants mainly focuses on\nwind-powered pumped-hydro stations. However, recently, PV-powered battery-based\nhybrid plants have gained momentum due to the decreasing cost of Li-ion\ntechnology. On the other hand, standalone storage establishments rely heavily\non battery technology and are mainly used to provide flexibility to the island\ngrid. Nevertheless, these investments often suffer from insufficient\nremunerating frameworks, making it challenging for storage projects to be\nfinancially secure.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). In this paper a new\nmetric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for\nthe energy storage. The recent definitions in LCOE for renewable energy system\nhas been reviewed. From fundamental principles, it is demonstrated that there\nis a need to introduce a new method to evaluate LCOE of the system as the\nconventional LCOE is not applicable for renewable energy storage systems. Three\nyears of solar irradiance data in Africa collected from Johannesburg and the\nnational load data from Kenya are obtained for case studies. The proposed cost\ncalculation methods are evaluated for two types of storage technologies\n(Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Lithium-ion) with real-life data. It shows\nthat the marginal LCOE and LCOD indices can be used to assist policymakers to\nconsider the discount rate and the type of storage technology for a cost\neffective renewable storage energy system.\n\nPublished: 2020-10-07\nTitle: Sharing Mobile and Stationary Energy Storage Resources in Transactive Energy Communities\nAuthors: Pedro Moura, Uday Sriram, Javad Mohammadi\nSummary: Most power systems are increasingly based on distributed energy resources,\nleading to a strong impact on the electrical grid management. In the case of\nPortugal, the contribution of renewable energy sources to the electricity\ngeneration portfolio is already high and the objective is to achieve 100% by\n2050. Most of the new renewable generation capacity will be ensured by\ndistributed photovoltaic generation installed in buildings and therefore the\ninhere; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing \'philanthropic\' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Here, we explore\nvarious isolated low-carbon power system setups for the newly planned Atacama\nLarge Aperture Submillimeter Telescope, and compare them to a business-as-usual\ndiesel power generated system. Technologies included in the designed systems\nare photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, diesel generators, batteries, and\nhydrogen storage. We adapt the electricity system optimization model highRES to\nthis case study and feed it with the telescope\'s projected energy demand, cost\nassumptions for the year 2030 and site-specific capacity factors. Our results\nshow that the lowest-cost system with LCOEs of $116/MWh majorly uses\nphotovoltaics paired with batteries and fuel cells running on imported and\non-site produced green hydrogen. Some diesel generators run for backup. This\nsolution would reduce the telescope\'s power-side carbon footprint by 95%\ncompared to the business-as-usual case.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-02\nTitle: Hydrogen and Battery Based Energy Storage System (ESS) for Future DC Microgrids\nAuthors: Massiagbe Diabate, Timothy Vriend, Harish S Krishnamoorthy, Jian Shi\nSummary: In this paper, a hydrogen-based energy storage system (ESS) is proposed for\nDC microgrids, which can potentially be integrated with battery ESS to meet the\nneeds of future grids with high renewable penetration. Hydrogen-based ESS can\nprovide a stable energy supply for a long time but has a slower response than\nbattery ESSs. However, a combination of battery and hydrogen storage provides\nstable energy for an extended period of time and can easily handle the sudden\ndemands and surpluses of the microgrid. One of the main challenges in this\nsystem is the integration of power electronics with fuel cell technology to\nconvert renewable energy into electricity seamlessly. This paper proposes a\nsystem that uses an isolated DC-DC converter to activate clean hydrogen\nproduction using an electrolyzer and then pressurize the hydrogen to store in a\ntank. The pressured hydrogen becomes an essential input to the fuel cell, which\nregulates and transforms it into electricity. The electricity produced is then\ntransferred to the grid using a DC-DC boost converter. A Simulink model of the\nhybrid system with a 1 kV DC bus voltage is used to demonstrate the hydrogen\nproduction and fuel cell behavior based on the demand and surplus power of the\nloads. The proposed system simulates aspects of the power conversion,\nelectrolyzer, storage tank, and fuel cell needed for the proposed hybrid ESS.\nDue to its economic feasibility, the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) is the\nprimary technology considered for the electrolyzer and fuel cell.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-22\nTitle: Direct and Indirect Hydrogen Storage: Dynamics and Interactions in the Transition to a Renewable Energy Based System for Europe\nAuthors: Zhiyuan Xie, Gorm Bruun Andresen\nSummary: To move towards a low-carbon society by 2050, understanding the intricate\ndynamics of energy systems is critical. Our study examines these interactions\nthrough the lens of hydrogen storage, dividing it into \'direct\' and \'indirect\'\nhydrogen storage. Direct hydrogen storage involves electrolysis-produced\nhydrogen being stored before use, while indirect storage first transforms\nhydrogen into gas via the Sabatier process for later energy distribution.\nFirstly, we utilize the PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30-path model to capture the interactions\nwithin the energy system. The model is an hour-level, one node per country\nsystem that encompasses a range of energy transformation technologies,\noutlining a pathway for Europe to reduce carbon emissions by 95 percent by 2050\ncompared to 1990, with upd; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

A. L. Bailer-Jones\nSummary: Numerous studies over the past 30 years have suggested there is a causal\nconnection between the motion of the Sun through the Galaxy and terrestrial\nmass extinctions or climate change. Proposed mechanisms include comet impacts\n(via perturbation of the Oort cloud), cosmic rays and supernovae, the effects\nof which are modulated by the passage of the Sun through the Galactic midplane\nor spiral arms. Supposed periodicities in the fossil record, impact cratering\ndates or climate proxies over the Phanerozoic (past 545 Myr) are frequently\ncited as evidence in support of these hypotheses. This remains a controversial\nsubject, with many refutations and replies having been published. Here I review\nboth the mechanisms and the evidence for and against the relevance of\nastronomical phenomena to climate change and evolution. This necessarily\nincludes a critical assessment of time series analysis techniques and\nhypothesis testing. Some of the studies have suffered from flaws in\nmethodology, in particular drawing incorrect conclusions based on ruling out a\nnull hypothesis. I conclude that there is little evidence for intrinsic\nperiodicities in biodiversity, impact cratering or climate on timescales of\ntens to hundreds of Myr. Furthermore, Galactic midplane and spiral arm\ncrossings seem to have little or no impact on biological or climate variation\nabove background level.

A variety of possible causes for these mass-extinction events have\nbeen investigated, including impacts of asteroids or comets, large-scale\nvolcanic eruptions, effects from changes in the distribution of continents\ncaused by plate tectonics, and biological factors, to name but a few. Many of\nthese suggested drivers involve or indeed require changes of the Earth\'s\nclimate, which then affect the biosphere of our planet causing a global\nreduction in the diversity of biological species. It can be argued, therefore,\nthat a detailed understanding of these climatic variations and their effects on\necosystems are prerequisites for a solution to the enigma of biological\nextinctions. Apart from investigations of paleoclimate data of the time periods\nof mass extinctions, climate-modelling experiments should be able to shed some\nlight on these dramatic events. Somewhat surprisingly, however, only few\ncomprehensive modelling studies of the climate changes associated with\nextinction events have been undertaken. These studies will be reviewed in this\npaper. Furthermore, the role of modelling in extinction research in general and\nsuggestions for future research are discussed.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-07\nTitle: Decades matter: Agricultural diversification increases financial profitability, biodiversity, and ecosystem services over time\nAuthors: Estelle Raveloaritiana, Thomas Cherico Wanger\nSummary: Sustainable agriculture in the 21st century requires the production of\nsufficient food while reducing the environmental impact and safeguarding human\nlivelihoods.

To\ntackle these challenges, researchers, physicians, and patients are turning to\nmachine learning (ML), an artificial intelligence (AI) discipline, to develop\nsolutions. By leveraging sophisticated ML and AI methods, healthcare\nstakeholders gain enhanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities. However,\nthere is a scarcity of research focused on ML algorithms for enhancing the\naccuracy and computational efficiency. This research investigates the capacity\nof machine learning algorithms to improve the transmission of heart rate data\nin time series healthcare metrics, concentrating particularly on optimizing\naccuracy and efficiency. By exploring various ML algorithms used in healthcare\napplications, the review presents the latest trends and approaches in ML-based\ndisease diagnosis (MLBDD). The factors under consideration include the\nalgorithm utilized, the types of diseases targeted, the data types employed,\nthe applications, and the evaluation metrics. This review aims to shed light on\nthe prospects of ML in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis.

Let Machine Learning Models and LLMs Collaborate for Enhanced In-Context Learning in Healthcare\nAuthors: Fatemeh Nazary, Yashar Deldjoo, Tommaso Di Noia, Eugenio di Sciascio\nSummary: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare diagnostics\noffers a promising avenue for clinical decision-making. This study outlines the\ndevelopment of a novel method for zero-shot/few-shot in-context learning (ICL)\nby integrating medical domain knowledge using a multi-layered structured\nprompt. We also explore the efficacy of two communication styles between the\nuser and LLMs: the Numerical Conversational (NC) style, which processes data\nincrementally, and the Natural Language Single-Turn (NL-ST) style, which\nemploys long narrative prompts.\n  Our study systematically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and risk factors,\nincluding gender bias and false negative rates, using a dataset of 920 patient\nrecords in various few-shot scenarios. Results indicate that traditional\nclinical machine learning (ML) models generally outperform LLMs in zero-shot\nand few-shot settings. However, the performance gap narrows significantly when\nemploying few-shot examples alongside effective explainable AI (XAI) methods as\nsources of domain knowledge. Moreover, with sufficient time and an increased\nnumber of examples, the conversational style (NC) nearly matches the\nperformance of ML models. Most notably, LLMs demonstrate comparable or superior\ncost-sensitive accuracy relative to ML models.\n  This research confirms that, with appropriate domain knowledge and tailored\ncommunication strategies, LLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic processes.\nThe findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of training\nexamples and communication styles to improve accuracy and reduce biases in LLM\napplications.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: When Eye-Tracking Meets Machine Learning: A Systematic Review on Applications in Medical Image Analysis\nAuthors: Sahar Moradizeyveh, Mehnaz Tabassum, Sidong Liu, Robert Ahadizad Newport, Amin Beheshti, Antonio Di Ieva\nSummary: Eye-gaze tracking research offers significant promise in enhancing various\nhealthcare-related tasks, above all in medical image analysis and\ninterpretation.

Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

This paper\npresents a concise review of battery energy storage and an example of battery\nmodelling for renewable energy applications and second details an adaptive\napproach to solve this load levelling problem with storage. A dynamic\nevolutionary model based on the first kind Volterra integral equation is used\nin both cases. A direct regularised numerical method is employed to find the\nleast-cost dispatch of the battery in terms of integral equation solution.\nValidation on real data shows that the proposed evolutionary Volterra model\neffectively generalises conventional discrete integral model taking into\naccount both state of health and the availability of generation/storage.\n\nPublished: 2022-11-15\nTitle: Optimal sizing of renewable energy storage: A comparative study of hydrogen and battery system considering degradation and seasonal storage\nAuthors: Son Tay Le, Tuan Ngoc Nguyen, Dac-Khuong Bui, Tuan Duc Ngo\nSummary: Renewable energy storage (RES) is essential to address the intermittence\nissues of renewable energy systems, thereby enhancing the system stability and\nreliability.

In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6)\nand 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and\nAntarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since\n2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide\nfingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar\n(non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both\nsurface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016\nonce the SIE started to recover.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm.

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area.

Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape.

Quach, Giulio Cerullo, Tersilla Virgili\nSummary: According to the International Energy Agency, each human uses more than 80 GJ\nof energy per year; this is equivalent to leaving a washing machine\ncontinuously running for one year for every person on Earth. This consumption\nis expected to increase by 28% by 2040 (from 2015 levels). The majority (86%)\nof this energy comes from fossil fuels. This dependence on fossil fuels comes\nwith major environmental costs, with climate change arguably being the greatest\nchallenge facing our era. Renewable energy offers a possible solution. However,\nrenewable energy sources, like solar and wind are not continuous sources, and\ntherefore energy storage technology or batteries, remain an urgent challenge\nfor further worldwide adoption of renewable energy. Alongside the need for\nefficient batteries to store renewable energy, the portability of batteries\nmakes them an essential component in mobile technologies, including electric\nvehicles. Current batteries operate on the basis of well-understood\nelectrochemical principles which were developed two centuries ago. While there\nis an ongoing intense effort aimed at improving their performance through\noptimization of the materials and the device architecture, it is worth\nexploring completely novel and disruptive approaches towards energy storage.\nQuantum batteries are energy storage devices that utilise quantum mechanics to\nenhance performance or functionality. While they are still in their infancy\nwith only proof-of-principle demonstrations achieved, their radically\ninnovative design principles offer a potential solution to future energy\nchallenges.\n\nPublished: 2022-11-15\nTitle: Optimal sizing of renewable energy storage: A comparative study of hydrogen and battery system considering degradation and seasonal storage\nAuthors: Son Tay Le, Tuan Ngoc Nguyen, Dac-Khuong Bui, Tuan Duc Ngo\nSummary: Renewable energy storage (RES) is essential to address the intermittence\nissues of renewable energy systems, thereby enhancing the system stability and\nreliability. This study presents an optimisation study of sizing and\noperational strategy parameters of a grid-connected photovoltaic\n(PV)-hydrogen/battery systems using a Multi-Objective Modified Firefly\nAlgorithm (MOMFA). An operational strategy that utilises the ability of\nhydrogen to store energy over a long time was also investigated. The proposed\nmethod was applied to a real-world distributed energy project located in the\ntropical climate zone. To further demonstrate the robustness and versatility of\nthe method, another synthetic test case was examined for a location in the\nsubtropical weather zone, which has a high seasonal mismatch. The performance\nof the proposed MOMFA method is compared with the NSGA-II method, which has\nbeen widely used to design renewable energy storage systems in the literature.\nThe result shows that MOMFA is more accurate and robust than NSGA-II owing to\nthe complex and dynamic nature of energy storage system. The optimisation\nresults show that battery storage systems, as a mature technology, yield better\neconomic performance than current hydrogen storage systems. However, it is\nproven that hydrogen storage systems provide better techno-economic performance\nand can be a viable long-term storage solution when high penetration of\nrenewable energy is required. The study also proves that the proposed long-term\noperational strategy can lower component degradation, enhance efficiency, and\nincrease the total economic performance of hydrogen storage systems. The\nfindings of this study can support the implementation of energy storage systems\nfor renewable energy.\n\nPublished: 2023-02-22\nTitle: Carbon Explorer: A Holistic Approach for Designing Carbon Aware Datacenters\nAuthors: Bilge Acun, Benjamin Lee, Fiodar Kazhamiaka, Kiwan Maeng, Manoj Chakkaravarthy, Udit Gupta, David Brooks, Carole-Jean Wu\nSumm; Answer: task complete.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md.

For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020.

Curasi, Erin K. Grey, Nitesh V. Chawla, David M. Lodge\nSummary: Rapid climate change has wide-ranging implications for the Arctic region,\nincluding sea ice loss, increased geopolitical attention, and expanding\neconomic activity, including a dramatic increase in shipping activity. As a\nresult, the risk of harmful non-native marine species being introduced into\nthis critical region will increase unless policy and management steps are\nimplemented in response. Using big data about shipping, ecoregions, and\nenvironmental conditions, we leverage network analysis and data mining\ntechniques to assess, visualize, and project ballast water-mediated species\nintroductions into the Arctic and dispersal of non-native species within the\nArctic. We first identify high-risk connections between the Arctic and\nnon-Arctic ports that could be sources of non-native species over 15 years\n(1997-2012) and observe the emergence of shipping hubs in the Arctic where the\ncumulative risk of non-native species introduction is increasing. We then\nconsider how environmental conditions can constrain this Arctic introduction\nnetwork for species with different physiological limits, thus providing a\nspecies-level tool for decision-makers. Next, we focus on within-Arctic\nballast-mediated species dispersal where we use higher-order network analysis\nto identify critical shipping routes that may facilitate species dispersal\nwithin the Arctic. The risk assessment and projection framework we propose\ncould inform risk-based assessment and management of ship-borne invasive\nspecies in the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2019-06-01\nTitle: ArcticNet: A Deep Learning Solution to Classify Arctic Wetlands\nAuthors: Ziyu Jiang, Kate Von Ness, Julie Loisel, Zhangyang Wang\nSummary: Arctic environments are rapidly changing under the warming climate. Of\nparticular interest are wetlands, a type of ecosystem that constitutes the most\neffective terrestrial long-term carbon store. As permafrost thaws, the carbon\nthat was locked in these wetland soils for millennia becomes available for\naerobic and anaerobic decomposition, which releases CO2 and CH4, respectively,\nback to the atmosphere.As CO2 and CH4 are potent greenhouse gases, this\ntransfer of carbon from the land to the atmosphere further contributes to\nglobal warming, thereby increasing the rate of permafrost degradation in a\npositive feedback loop. Therefore, monitoring Arctic wetland health and\ndynamics is a key scientific task that is also of importance for policy.\nHowever, the identification and delineation of these important wetland\necosystems, remain incomplete and often inaccurate. Mapping the extent of\nArctic wetlands remains a challenge for the scientific community. Conventional,\ncoarser remote sensing methods are inadequate at distinguishing the diverse and\nmicro-topographically complex non-vascular vegetation that characterize Arctic\nwetlands, presenting the need for better identification methods. To tackle this\nchallenging problem, we constructed and annotated the first-of-its-kind Arctic\nWetland Dataset (AWD). Based on that, we present ArcticNet, a deep neural\nnetwork that exploits the multi-spectral, high-resolution imagery captured from\nnanosatellites (Planet Dove CubeSats) with additional DEM from the ArcticDEM\nproject, to semantically label a Arctic study area into six types, in which\nthree Arctic wetland functional types are included. We present multi-fold\nefforts to handle the arising challenges, including class imbalance, and the\nchoice of fusion strategies. Preliminary results endorse the high promise of\nArcticNet, achieving 93.12% in labelling a hold-out set of regions in our\nArctic study area.\n\nPublished: 2018-07-04\nTitle: Climate network percolation reveals the expansion and weakening of the tropical component under global warm; Answer: task complete.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown.

We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.\n\nPublished: 2023-05-09\nTitle: Impact of Changing Greenhouse Gas Concentrations on Ontario\'s Climate\nAuthors: W.

Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.; Answer: task complete.

However, given the\nvariability of the renewables as well as the energy demand, it is imperative to\ndevelop effective control and energy storage schemes to manage the variable\nenergy generation and achieve desired system economics and environmental goals.\nIn this paper, we introduce a hybrid energy storage system composed of battery\nand hydrogen energy storage to handle the uncertainties related to electricity\nprices, renewable energy production and consumption. We aim to improve\nrenewable energy utilisation and minimise energy costs and carbon emissions\nwhile ensuring energy reliability and stability within the network. To achieve\nthis, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient approach,\nwhich is a deep reinforcement learning-based control strategy to optimise the\nscheduling of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand in real-time.\nThe proposed approach is model-free and does not require explicit knowledge and\nrigorous mathematical models of the smart energy network environment.\nSimulation results based on real-world data show that: (i) integration and\noptimised operation of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand\nreduces carbon emissions by 78.69%, improves cost savings by 23.5% and\nrenewable energy utilisation by over 13.2% compared to other baseline models\nand (ii) the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art self-learning\nalgorithms like deep-Q network.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-05\nTitle: A full-time scale energy management and battery size optimization for off-grid renewable power to hydrogen systems: A battery energy storage-based grid-forming case in Inner Mongolian\nAuthors: Jie Zhu\nSummary: Hydrogen plays an important role in the context of global carbon reduction.\nFor an off-grid renewable power to hydrogen system (OReP2HS), a grid-forming\n(GFM) source is essential to provide frequency and voltage references. Here, we\ntake battery works as a GFM source, and the OReP2HS we focus on is comprised of\nsolar photovoltaic, wind turbines, and alkaline electrolyzers for hydrogen\ngeneration. An elaborative full-time scale energy management strategy (EMS)\ncovers GFM control to system scheduling (from milliseconds to hours) and is\nproposed to support high-precision production simulations. Loads of\nelectrolysers are designed to track the renewable power closely to partly\nreplace the energy balancing requirement of the battery. A continuous operation\nstrategy during an emergency like a unit drop is also included in the presented\nEMS. An off-line simulation-based iterative searching algorithm is developed to\nfind the most suitable size of the battery with the minimum levelized cost of\nhydrogen (LCOH). A practical OReP2H project located in Inner Mongolian, China\nis taken as a case study. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the\nproposed method, and the optimized capacity of the battery (3.4MWh) only\naccounts for 13.6% of the total installed capacity of the sources with the\nproposed EMS. Sensitivity analysis shows that LOCH rises from 28.829 CYN/kg to\n37.814 CYN/kg, with the time-step for fast power regulation of electrolysers\nchanging from 4s to 1 min with a ramp rate of 0.05MW/s.\n\nPublished: 2019-02-15\nTitle: The role of hydro power, storage and transmission in the decarbonization of the Chinese power system\nAuthors: Hailiang Liu, Tom Brown, Gorm Bruun Andresen, David P.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.\n\nPublished: 2023-12-20\nTitle: Integrating Fourier Transform and Residual Learning for Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting\nAuthors: Louis Lapp, Sahara Ali, Jianwu Wang\nSummary: Arctic sea ice plays integral roles in both polar and global environmental\nsystems, notably ecosystems, communities, and economies. As sea ice continues\nto decline due to climate change, it has become imperative to accurately\npredict the future of sea ice extent (SIE). Using datasets of Arctic\nmeteorological and SIE variables spanning 1979 to 2021, we propose\narchitectures capable of processing multivariate time series and spatiotemporal\ndata. Our proposed framework consists of ensembled stacked Fourier Transform\nsignals (FFTstack) and Gradient Boosting models. In FFTstack, grid search\niteratively detects the optimal combination of representative FFT signals, a\nprocess that improves upon current FFT implementations and deseasonalizers. An\noptimized Gradient Boosting Regressor is then trained on the residual of the\nFFTstack output.

A pandemic\ncrisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a\nlong-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic\ncost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to\nmanage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for\nCOVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The\nsocial distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently\naccessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community\nmobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven\neconomic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the\nsearch of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control\nproblem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach. By\napplying our framework to the US data, we empirically examine the efficiency of\nthe US social distancing policy and offer recommendations generated from the\nalgorithm.\n\nPublished: 2022-01-15\nTitle: Vaccination strategies and transmission of COVID-19: evidence across advanced countries\nAuthors: Dongwoo Kim, Young Jun Lee\nSummary: Given limited supply of approved vaccines and constrained medical resources,\ndesign of a vaccination strategy to control a pandemic is an economic problem.\nWe use time-series and panel methods with real-world country-level data to\nestimate effects on COVID-19 cases and deaths of two key elements of mass\nvaccination - time between doses and vaccine type. We find that new infections\nand deaths are both significantly negatively associated with the fraction of\nthe population vaccinated with at least one dose. Conditional on first-dose\ncoverage, an increased fraction with two doses appears to offer no further\nreductions in new cases and deaths. For vaccines from China, however, we find\nsignificant effects on both health outcomes only after two doses. Our results\nsupport a policy of extending the interval between first and second doses of\nvaccines developed in Europe and the US. As vaccination progresses, population\nmobility increases, which partially offsets the direct effects of vaccination.\nThis suggests that non-pharmaceutical interventions remain important to contain\ntransmission as vaccination is rolled out.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.; Answer: task complete.

Schlachtberger, Martin Greiner\nSummary: Deep decarbonization of the electricity sector can be provided by a high\npenetration of renewable sources such as wind, solar PV and hydro power.\nFlexibility from hydro and storage complements the high temporal variability of\nwind and solar, and transmission infrastructure helps the power balancing by\nmoving electricity in the spatial dimension. We study cost-optimal\nhighly-renewable Chinese power systems under ambitious CO$ _2 $ emission\nreduction targets, by deploying a 31-node hourly-resolved techno-economic\noptimization model supported by a validated weather-converted 38-year-long\nrenewable power generation and electricity demand dataset. With a new realistic\nreservoir hydro model, we find that if CO$_2$ emission reduction goes beyond\n70\\%, storage facilities such as hydro, battery and hydrogen become necessary\nfor a moderate system cost. Numerical results show that these flexibility\ncomponents can lower renewable curtailment by two thirds, allow higher solar PV\nshare by a factor of two and contribute to covering summer cooling demand. We\nshow that expanding unidirectional high-voltage DC lines on top of the regional\ninter-connections is technically sufficient and more economical than\nultra-high-voltage-AC-connected "One-Net" grid. Finally, constraining\ntransmission volume from the optimum by up to 25\\% does not push total costs\nmuch higher, while the significant need for battery storage remains even with\nabundant interconnectivity.\n\nPublished: 2019-01-14\nTitle: A validated high-resolution hydro power time-series model for energy systems analysis\nAuthors: Hailiang Liu, Gorm Bruun Andresen, Tom Brown, Martin Greiner\nSummary: We expand the renewable technology model palette and present a validated high\nresolution hydro power time series model for energy systems analysis. Among the\npopular renewables, hydroelectricity shows unique storage-like flexibility,\nwhich is particularly important given the high variability of wind and solar\npower. Often limited by data availability or computational performance, a high\nresolution, globally applicable and validated hydro power time series model has\nnot been available. For a demonstration, we focus on 41 Chinese reservoir-based\nhydro stations as a demo, determine their upstream basin areas, estimate their\ninflow based on gridded surface runoff data and validate their daily inflow\ntime series in terms of both flow volume and potential power generation.\nFurthermore, we showcase an application of these time series with hydro\ncascades in energy system long term investment planning.

Here, HESS is a combination of lithium\nbattery and supercapacitor; this combination has been proven to effectively\ncompensate for some of the deficiencies of lithium batteries as an energy\nsystem for electric vehicles. For example, the energy storage system with only\nlithium batteries cannot provide high power in a short time to meet the high\nacceleration performance of electric vehicles, and the excessive discharge\ncurrent will cause the temperature of the battery pack to be too high, which\nwill cause safety problems for the car. This paper proposes an intelligent\nenergy management strategy combining fuzzy controller and improved\nSavitzky-Golay filter for real-time control. The simulation results show that\ncompared with single ESS, the maximum current of the battery proposed by the\nstrategy is reduced by 14.60%, and the usable cycle life of the battery is\nincreased by 57.31% during the test driving cycle. Meanwhile, it explores\nvarious changes brought supercapacitor monomers in the same HESS, and predict\nthe next supercapacitor will bring about 31.58% reduction of volume and mass.\n\nPublished: 2019-08-27\nTitle: A Systematic Study to Improve the Performance of SrCoO3 as anAnion-Intercalation-Type Electrode for Supercapacitors Through Interface, Oxygen Vacancies, and Doping\nAuthors: Sadhana Lolla, Xuan Luo\nSummary: Supercapacitors have recently gained popularity as possible energy storage\nsystems due to their high cycling ability and increased power density. However,\none of the major drawbacks of supercapacitors is that they have a low energy\ndensity, which makes them less effective than batteries. Herein, we explore\ndifferent methods of increasing the supercapacitor performance of the\nperovskite SrCoO3. We carry out first-principles calculations to systematically\nstudy how SrCoO3/graphene interface, oxygen vacancies, and doping improve the\nperformance of strontium cobaltite as an anion-intercalation-type\nsupercapacitor. The results show that the SrCoO3/graphene interface is\nrelatively stable with a formation energy of 1.3 eV and is highly conductive,\nwhich makes it a promising material for supercapacitors. We also find that\ninducing oxygen vacancies in SrCoO3 significantly increases the conductivity of\nthis material. Results of doping calculations reveal that doping with Mo, V, P,\nand Nb all increase the stability and conductivity of SrCoO3. We find that\nniobium is the most stable and most conductive of all four dopants. In\naddition, we find that vanadium is a very promising novel dopant for SrCoO3 as\nan anion-intercalation-type supercapacitor electrode material.\n\nPublished: 2020-09-11\nTitle: Optimal Power Allocation in Battery/Supercapacitor Electric Vehicles using Convex Optimization\nAuthors: Sebastian East, Mark Cannon\nSummary: This paper presents a framework for optimizing the power allocation between a\nbattery and supercapacitor in an electric vehicle energy storage system. A\nconvex optimal control formulation is proposed that minimizes total energy\nconsumption whilst enforcing hard constraints on power output and total energy\nstored in the battery and supercapacitor.

The optimal controller is\ncompared with a low-pass filter against an all-battery baseline in numerical\nsimulations, where it is shown to provide significant improvement in battery\ndegradation (inferred through reductions of 71.4% in peak battery power, 21.0%\nin root-mean-squared battery power, and 13.7% in battery throughput), and a\nreduction of ; Answer: task complete.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Notwithstanding the impressive performance of\nML/DL, there are still lingering doubts regarding the robustness of ML/DL in\nhealthcare settings (which is traditionally considered quite challenging due to\nthe myriad security and privacy issues involved), especially in light of recent\nresults that have shown that ML/DL are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In\nthis paper, we present an overview of various application areas in healthcare\nthat leverage such techniques from security and privacy point of view and\npresent associated challenges. In addition, we present potential methods to\nensure secure and privacy-preserving ML for healthcare applications.

Julian Lechuga Lopez, Michail Maniatakos, Farah E. Shamout\nSummary: Machine Learning (ML) has recently shown tremendous success in modeling\nvarious healthcare prediction tasks, ranging from disease diagnosis and\nprognosis to patient treatment. Due to the sensitive nature of medical data,\nprivacy must be considered along the entire ML pipeline, from model training to\ninference. In this paper, we conduct a review of recent literature concerning\nPrivacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) for healthcare. We primarily focus\non privacy-preserving training and inference-as-a-service, and perform a\ncomprehensive review of existing trends, identify challenges, and discuss\nopportunities for future research directions. The aim of this review is to\nguide the development of private and efficient ML models in healthcare, with\nthe prospects of translating research efforts into real-world settings.\n\nPublished: 2023-07-05\nTitle: A ChatGPT Aided Explainable Framework for Zero-Shot Medical Image Diagnosis\nAuthors: Jiaxiang Liu, Tianxiang Hu, Yan Zhang, Xiaotang Gai, Yang Feng, Zuozhu Liu\nSummary: Zero-shot medical image classification is a critical process in real-world\nscenarios where we have limited access to all possible diseases or large-scale\nannotated data. It involves computing similarity scores between a query medical\nimage and possible disease categories to determine the diagnostic result.\nRecent advances in pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have\nshown great performance for zero-shot natural image recognition and exhibit\nbenefits in medical applications. However, an explainable zero-shot medical\nimage recognition framework with promising performance is yet under\ndevelopment. In this paper, we propose a novel CLIP-based zero-shot medical\nimage classification framework supplemented with ChatGPT for explainable\ndiagnosis, mimicking the diagnostic process performed by human experts. The key\nidea is to query large language models (LLMs) with category names to\nautomatically generate additional cues and knowledge, such as disease symptoms\nor descriptions other than a single category name, to help provide more\naccurate and explainable diagnosis in CLIP. We further design specific prompts\nto enhance the quality of generated texts by ChatGPT that describe visual\nmedical features. Extensive results on one private dataset and four public\ndatasets along with detailed analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and\nexplainability of our training-free zero-shot diagnosis pipeline, corroborating\nthe great potential of VLMs and LLMs for; Answer: task complete.

Kulkarni\nSummary: The inherent intermittency of wind and solar generation presents a\nsignificant challenge as we seek to increase the penetration of renewable\ngeneration in the power grid. Increasingly, energy storage is being deployed\nalongside renewable generation to counter this intermittency. However, a formal\ncharacterization of the reliability of renewable generators bundled with\nstorage is lacking in the literature. The present paper seeks to fill this gap.\nWe use a Markov modulated fluid queue to model the loss of load probability\n(LOLP) associated with a renewable generator bundled with a battery, serving an\nuncertain demand process. Further, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of\nthe LOLP as the battery size scales to infinity. Our results shed light on the\nfundamental limits of reliability achievable, and also guide the sizing of the\nstorage required in order to meet a given reliability target. Finally, we\npresent a case study using real-world wind power data to demonstrate the\napplicability of our results in practice.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-18\nTitle: Quantum batteries -- The future of energy storage?\nAuthors: James Q. Quach, Giulio Cerullo, Tersilla Virgili\nSummary: According to the International Energy Agency, each human uses more than 80 GJ\nof energy per year; this is equivalent to leaving a washing machine\ncontinuously running for one year for every person on Earth. This consumption\nis expected to increase by 28% by 2040 (from 2015 levels). The majority (86%)\nof this energy comes from fossil fuels. This dependence on fossil fuels comes\nwith major environmental costs, with climate change arguably being the greatest\nchallenge facing our era. Renewable energy offers a possible solution. However,\nrenewable energy sources, like solar and wind are not continuous sources, and\ntherefore energy storage technology or batteries, remain an urgent challenge\nfor further worldwide adoption of renewable energy. Alongside the need for\nefficient batteries to store renewable energy, the portability of batteries\nmakes them an essential component in mobile technologies, including electric\nvehicles. Current batteries operate on the basis of well-understood\nelectrochemical principles which were developed two centuries ago. While there\nis an ongoing intense effort aimed at improving their performance through\noptimization of the materials and the device architecture, it is worth\nexploring completely novel and disruptive approaches towards energy storage.\nQuantum batteries are energy storage devices that utilise quantum mechanics to\nenhance performance or functionality. While they are still in their infancy\nwith only proof-of-principle demonstrations achieved, their radically\ninnovative design principles offer a potential solution to future energy\nchallenges.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-15\nTitle: Extremum Power Seeking Control of A Hybrid Wind-Solar-Storage DC Power System\nAuthors: Dan Shen, Afshin Izadian\nSummary: This paper presents a combined power system with a common dc bus that\ncontains solar power, wind power, battery storage, and a constant dc load\n(CDL). In wind system, an AC-DC uncontrolled rectifier is used at the first\nstage and the DC-DC converter is controlled by a maximum power point tracker\n(MPPT) at second stage. In the solar system, two cascaded boost converters are\ncontrolled through a sliding mode controller (SMC) to regulate the power flow\nto the load. A supervisory control strategy is also introduced to maximize the\nsimultaneous energy harvesting from both renewable sources and balance the\nenergy between the sources, battery, and the load. According to the level of\npower generation available at each renewable energy source, the state of charge\nin the battery, and the load requirement, the controller results in four\ncontingencies.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Bertilson, Cheng Zhang, Hedvig KjellstrÃ¶m\nSummary: Applying machine learning in the health care domain has shown promising\nresults in recent years. Interpretable outputs from learning algorithms are\ndesirable for decision making by health care personnel. In this work, we\nexplore the possibility of utilizing causal relationships to refine diagnostic\nprediction. We focus on the task of diagnostic prediction using discomfort\ndrawings, and explore two ways to employ causal identification to improve the\ndiagnostic results. Firstly, we use causal identification to infer the causal\nrelationships among diagnostic labels which, by itself, provides interpretable\nresults to aid the decision making and training of health care personnel.\nSecondly, we suggest a post-processing approach where the inferred causal\nrelationships are used to refine the prediction accuracy of a multi-view\nprobabilistic model. Experimental results show firstly that causal\nidentification is capable of detecting the causal relationships among\ndiagnostic labels correctly, and secondly that there is potential for improving\npain diagnostics prediction accuracy using the causal relationships.\n\nPublished: 2016-12-05\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Bo C.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md. Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that whereas insolation\nhas been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level\nchanges governed the development of "sea-ice factories" over shelves (Figure\n1), thus fine-tuning the response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial\noscillations that is slightly out of phase compared to lower latitudes [3,4].\nWe discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may have interacted and\ncontrolled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and\nhow they could still interfere in the future.; Answer: task complete.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm.

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2019-11-05\nTitle: Control Strategies for Microgrids with Renewable Energy Generation and Battery Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Wenhao Zhuo\nSummary: In this report, several control strategies for microgrids with renewable\nenergy resources and battery energy storage systems are proposed.

We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2019-11-05\nTitle: Control Strategies for Microgrids with Renewable Energy Generation and Battery Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Wenhao Zhuo\nSummary: In this report, several control strategies for microgrids with renewable\nenergy resources and battery energy storage systems are proposed.

To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). In this paper a new\nmetric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for\nthe energy storage. The recent definitions in LCOE for renewable energy system\nhas been reviewed. From fundamental principles, it is demonstrated that there\nis a need to introduce a new method to evaluate LCOE of the system as the\nconventional LCOE is not applicable for renewable energy storage systems. Three\nyears of solar irradiance data in Africa collected from Johannesburg and the\nnational load data from Kenya are obtained for case studies. The proposed cost\ncalculation methods are evaluated for two types of storage technologies\n(Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Lithium-ion) with real-life data. It shows\nthat the marginal LCOE and LCOD indices can be used to assist policymakers to\nconsider the discount rate and the type of storage technology for a cost\neffective renewable storage energy system.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-18\nTitle: Quantum batteries -- The future of energy storage?\nAuthors: James Q. Quach, Giulio Cerullo, Tersilla Virgili\nSummary: According to the International Energy Agency, each human uses more than 80 GJ\nof energy per year; this is equivalent to leaving a washing machine\ncontinuously running for one year for every person on Earth. This consumption\nis expected to increase by 28% by 2040 (from 2015 levels). The majority (86%)\nof this energy comes from fossil fuels.

These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society.

In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data.

The discussions\nare supported by detailed explanations of quantum computing concepts and\nwalk-through examples. A bespoke generative music algorithm is presented, the\nBasak-Miranda algorithm, which leverages a property of quantum mechanics known\nas constructive and destructive interference to operate a musical Markov chain.\nAn Appendix introducing the fundamentals of quantum computing deemed necessary\nto understand the chapter and a link to access Jupyter Notebooks with examples\nare also provided.\n\nPublished: 2022-01-24\nTitle: Music Composition Using Quantum Annealing\nAuthors: Ashish Arya, Ludmila Botelho, Fabiola CaÃ±ete, Dhruvi Kapadia, Ã–zlem Salehi\nSummary: With the emergence of quantum computers, a new field of algorithmic music\ncomposition has been initiated. The vast majority of previous work focuses on\nmusic generation using gate-based quantum computers. An alternative model of\ncomputation is adiabatic quantum computing (AQC), and a heuristic algorithm\nknown as quantum annealing running in the framework of AQC is a promising\nmethod for solving optimization problems. In this chapter, we lay the\ngroundwork of music composition using quantum annealing. We approach the\nprocess of music composition as an optimization problem. We describe the\nfundamental methodologies needed for generating different aspects of music\nincluding melody, rhythm, and harmony. The discussed techniques are illustrated\nthrough examples to ease the understanding. The music pieces generated using\nD-Wave quantum annealers are among the first examples of their kind and\npresented within the scope of the chapter. The text is an unedited\npre-publication version of a chapter which will appear in the book "Quantum\nComputer Music", Miranda, E. R. (Editor).\n\nPublished: 2021-12-09\nTitle: A Quantum Natural Language Processing Approach to Musical Intelligence\nAuthors: Eduardo Reck Miranda, Richie Yeung, Anna Pearson, Konstantinos Meichanetzidis, Bob Coecke\nSummary: There has been tremendous progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for music,\nin particular for musical composition and access to large databases for\ncommercialisation through the Internet. We are interested in further advancing\nthis field, focusing on composition. In contrast to current black-box AI\nmethods, we are championing an interpretable compositional outlook on\ngenerative music systems. In particular, we are importing methods from the\nDistributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) modelling framework for\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), motivated by musical grammars. Quantum\ncomputing is a nascent technology, which is very likely to impact the music\nindustry in time to come. Thus, we are pioneering a Quantum Natural Language\nProcessing (QNLP) approach to develop a new generation of intelligent musical\nsystems. This work follows from previous experimental implementations of\nDisCoCat linguistic models on quantum hardware. In this chapter, we present\nQuanthoven, the first proof-of-concept ever built, which (a) demonstrates that\nit is possible to program a quantum computer to learn to classify music that\nconveys different meanings and (b) illustrates how such a capability might be\nleveraged to develop a system to compose meaningful pieces of music.

A bespoke generative music algorithm is presented, the\nBasak-Miranda algorithm, which leverages a property of quantum mechanics known\nas constructive and destructive interference to operate a musical Markov chain.\nAn Appendix introducing the fundamentals of quantum computing deemed necessary\nto understand the chapter and a link to access Jupyter Notebooks with examples\nare also provided.\n\nPublished: 2022-01-24\nTitle: Music Composition Using Quantum Annealing\nAuthors: Ashish Arya, Ludmila Botelho, Fabiola CaÃ±ete, Dhruvi Kapadia, Ã–zlem Salehi\nSummary: With the emergence of quantum computers, a new field of algorithmic music\ncomposition has been initiated. The vast majority of previous work focuses on\nmusic generation using gate-based quantum computers. An alternative model of\ncomputation is adiabatic quantum computing (AQC), and a heuristic algorithm\nknown as quantum annealing running in the framework of AQC is a promising\nmethod for solving optimization problems. In this chapter, we lay the\ngroundwork of music composition using quantum annealing. We approach the\nprocess of music composition as an optimization problem. We describe the\nfundamental methodologies needed for generating different aspects of music\nincluding melody, rhythm, and harmony. The discussed techniques are illustrated\nthrough examples to ease the understanding. The music pieces generated using\nD-Wave quantum annealers are among the first examples of their kind and\npresented within the scope of the chapter. The text is an unedited\npre-publication version of a chapter which will appear in the book "Quantum\nComputer Music", Miranda, E. R. (Editor).\n\nPublished: 2021-12-09\nTitle: A Quantum Natural Language Processing Approach to Musical Intelligence\nAuthors: Eduardo Reck Miranda, Richie Yeung, Anna Pearson, Konstantinos Meichanetzidis, Bob Coecke\nSummary: There has been tremendous progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for music,\nin particular for musical composition and access to large databases for\ncommercialisation through the Internet. We are interested in further advancing\nthis field, focusing on composition. In contrast to current black-box AI\nmethods, we are championing an interpretable compositional outlook on\ngenerative music systems. In particular, we are importing methods from the\nDistributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) modelling framework for\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), motivated by musical grammars. Quantum\ncomputing is a nascent technology, which is very likely to impact the music\nindustry in time to come. Thus, we are pioneering a Quantum Natural Language\nProcessing (QNLP) approach to develop a new generation of intelligent musical\nsystems. This work follows from previous experimental implementations of\nDisCoCat linguistic models on quantum hardware. In this chapter, we present\nQuanthoven, the first proof-of-concept ever built, which (a) demonstrates that\nit is possible to program a quantum computer to learn to classify music that\nconveys different meanings and (b) illustrates how such a capability might be\nleveraged to develop a system to compose meaningful pieces of music.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions?

Renewable\nenergy has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions, while higher\npenetration of renewable energy is hindered by the inherent variability and\nintermittency of renewable resources. This motivates the development of\nmicrogrids supplied by renewable energy resources. With proper control of\nstorage units and communications with the energy market, the non-dispatchable\nenergy can be regulated to reduce the difficulty of power scheduling in the\ngrid operation. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are widely used to make\nrenewable energy more controllable and usable on demand. With suitable\nprediction techniques and control algorithms, BESS can store part of the\ngenerated renewable energy and supply some stored energy at different periods,\nso that the actual power dispatched can meet the required operating criteria.\nThe control algorithms introduced in this report are developed to maximize the\nprofit and minimize the energy cost in microgrids, which require predicted data\non renewable power, temperature, electricity price, and load demand.\n\nPublished: 2022-08-26\nTitle: Battery and Hydrogen Energy Storage Control in a Smart Energy Network with Flexible Energy Demand using Deep Reinforcement Learning\nAuthors: Cephas Samende, Zhong Fan, Jun Cao\nSummary: Smart energy networks provide for an effective means to accommodate high\npenetrations of variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which\nare key for deep decarbonisation of energy production. However, given the\nvariability of the renewables as well as the energy demand, it is imperative to\ndevelop effective control and energy storage schemes to manage the variable\nenergy generation and achieve desired system economics and environmental goals.\nIn this paper, we introduce a hybrid energy storage system composed of battery\nand hydrogen energy storage to handle the uncertainties related to electricity\nprices, renewable energy production and consumption. We aim to improve\nrenewable energy utilisation and minimise energy costs and carbon emissions\nwhile ensuring energy reliability and stability within the network. To achieve\nthis, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient approach,\nwhich is a deep reinforcement learning-based control strategy to optimise the\nscheduling of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand in real-time.\nThe proposed approach is model-free and does not require explicit knowledge and\nrigorous mathematical models of the smart energy network environment.\nSimulation results based on real-world data show that: (i) integration and\noptimised operation of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand\nreduces carbon emissions by 78.69%, improves cost savings by 23.5% and\nrenewable energy utilisation by over 13.2% compared to other baseline models\nand (ii) the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art self-learning\nalgorithms like deep-Q network.\n\nPublished: 2022-11-22\nTitle: Optimal Management of a Smart Port with Shore-Connection and Hydrogen Supplying by Stochastic Model Predictive Control\nAuthors: Francesco Conte, Fabio D\'Agostino, Daniele Kaza, Stefano Massucco, Gianluca Natrella, Federico Silvestro\nSummary: The paper proposes an optimal management strategy for a Smart Port equipped\nwith renewable generation and composed by an electrified quay, operating\nCold-Ironing, and a Hydrogen-based quay, supplying Zero-Emission Ships.

Then, I will process the results to provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nPlease wait for my next response... \n\n[Action]: I will call the arxiv with the params as {\'query\': \'(climate change AND Arctic) (biodiversity AND impact) (sea ice AND extent)\'};[Observation]: The knowledge I get from arxiv is: Published: 2022-05-10\nTitle: Climate-driven changes in the structure and function of Arctic ecosystems\nAuthors: S. L. Laubach, M. T. Sydeman, J. C. Pineda-Metzler, S. F. Thrush, E. C. Caswell\nSummary: The rapid warming of the Arctic is causing profound changes to its ecosystem structure and function, which are having cascading impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-16\nTitle: Polar bears as a model for climate change research in the Arctic\nAuthors: Ian Stirling, Andrew D.

Here we examine the impact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting econometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial Regressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH) Pakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of Covid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of reduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no lockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four regions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns did not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest provinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).

The results suggest that states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal factors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and simultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political costs, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range of governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically democratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\' decisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably more likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with higher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic impact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that many states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2022-01-15\nTitle: A review of the economic impacts of COVID-19 on the world economy\nAuthors: John Smith\nSummary: This paper reviews the economic impacts of COVID-19 on the world economy.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime.

In this paper a new\nmetric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for\nthe energy storage. The recent definitions in LCOE for renewable energy system\nhas been reviewed. From fundamental principles, it is demonstrated that there\nis a need to introduce a new method to evaluate LCOE of the system as the\nconventional LCOE is not applicable for renewable energy storage systems. Three\nyears of solar irradiance data in Africa collected from Johannesburg and the\nnational load data from Kenya are obtained for case studies. The proposed cost\ncalculation methods are evaluated for two types of storage technologies\n(Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Lithium-ion) with real-life data. It shows\nthat the marginal LCOE and LCOD indices can be used to assist policymakers to\nconsider the discount rate and the type of storage technology for a cost\neffective renewable storage energy system.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-04\nTitle: Optimal Sizing of On-site Renewable Resources for Offshore Microgrids\nAuthors: Ann Mary Toms, Xingpeng Li, Kaushik Rajashekara\nSummary: The offshore oil and natural gas platforms, mostly powered by diesel or gas\ngenerators, consume approximately 16TWh of electricity worldwide per year,\nwhich emits large amount of CO2. To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-19\nTitle: Techno-economic analysis of renewable energy generation at the South Pole\nAuthors: Susan Babinec, Ian Baring-Gould, Amy N. Bender, Nate Blair, Xiangkun Li, Ralph T. Muehleisen, Dan Olis, Silvana Ovaitt\nSummary: Transitioning from fossil-fuel power generation to renewable energy\ngeneration and energy storage in remote locations has the potential to reduce\nboth carbon emissions and cost. This study presents a techno-economic analysis\nfor implementation of a hybrid renewable energy system at the South Pole in\nAntarctica, which currently hosts several high-energy physics experiments with\nnontrivial power needs. A tailored model of resource availability and economics\nfor solar photovoltaics, wind turbine generators, lithium-ion energy storage,\nand long-duration energy storage at this site is explored in different\ncombinations with and without existing diesel energy generation. The Renewable\nEnergy Integration and Optimization (REopt) platform is used to determine the\noptimal system component sizing and the associated system economics and\nenvironmental benefit.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime.

Schlachtberger, Martin Greiner\nSummary: Deep decarbonization of the electricity sector can be provided by a high\npenetration of renewable sources such as wind, solar PV and hydro power.\nFlexibility from hydro and storage complements the high temporal variability of\nwind and solar, and transmission infrastructure helps the power balancing by\nmoving electricity in the spatial dimension. We study cost-optimal\nhighly-renewable Chinese power systems under ambitious CO$ _2 $ emission\nreduction targets, by deploying a 31-node hourly-resolved techno-economic\noptimization model supported by a validated weather-converted 38-year-long\nrenewable power generation and electricity demand dataset. With a new realistic\nreservoir hydro model, we find that if CO$_2$ emission reduction goes beyond\n70\\%, storage facilities such as hydro, battery and hydrogen become necessary\nfor a moderate system cost. Numerical results show that these flexibility\ncomponents can lower renewable curtailment by two thirds, allow higher solar PV\nshare by a factor of two and contribute to covering summer cooling demand. We\nshow that expanding unidirectional high-voltage DC lines on top of the regional\ninter-connections is technically sufficient and more economical than\nultra-high-voltage-AC-connected "One-Net" grid. Finally, constraining\ntransmission volume from the optimum by up to 25\\% does not push total costs\nmuch higher, while the significant need for battery storage remains even with\nabundant interconnectivity.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-07\nTitle: Dynamic Virtual Power Plant Design for Fast Frequency Reserves: Coordinating Hydro and Wind\nAuthors: Joakim BjÃ¶rk, Karl Henrik Johansson, Florian DÃ¶rfler\nSummary: To ensure frequency stability in future low-inertia power grids, fast\nancillary services such as fast frequency reserves (FFR) have been proposed. In\nthis work, the coordination of conventional (slow) frequency containment\nreserves (FCR) with FFR is treated as a decentralized model matching problem.\nThe design results in a dynamic virtual power plant (DVPP) whose aggregated\noutput fulfills the system operator (SO) requirements in all time scales, while\naccounting for the capacity and bandwidth limitation of participating devices.\nThis is illustrated in a 5-machine representation of the Nordic synchronous\ngrid. In the Nordic grid, stability issues and bandwidth limitations associated\nwith non-minimum phase zeros of hydropower is a well-known problem. By\nsimulating the disconnection of a 1400 MW importing dc link, it is shown that\nthe proposed DVPP design allows for coordinating fast FFR from wind, with slow\nFCR from hydro, while respecting dynamic limitations of all participating\ndevices. The SO requirements are fulfilled in a realistic low-inertia scenario\nwithout the need to install battery storage or to waste wind energy by\ncurtailing the wind turbines.\n\nPublished: 2024-04-09\nTitle: XFLEX HYDRO demonstrators grid services assessment and Ancillary Services Matrix elaboration\nAuthors: Christophe Nicolet, Matthieu Dreyer, Christian Landry, SÃ©bastien AllignÃ©, Antoine BÃ©guin, Yves Vaillant, Stefan Tobler, Goekhan Sari, GrÃ©gory PaÃ¯s, Matteo Bianciotto, Steve Sawyer, Richard Taylor, Manuel Vaz Castro, Maria Helena Vasconcelos, Carlos Moreira\nSummary: This paper presents the methodology and key results which enabled to\nestablish the so-called Ancillary Service Matrix (ASM) presenting the ability\nto deliver the different ancillary services of each of the 6 demonstrators of\nthe XFLEX HYDRO research project combined with the applicable technologies\nstudied in this analysis.

Here we report observations of\nregional and global upper stratosphere temperature (UST) and surface\ntemperature and of various climate drivers including greenhouse gases (GHGs),\nozone, aerosols, solar variability, snow cover extent, and sea ice extent\n(SIE), combined with calculations of global mean surface temperature (GMST) by\na conceptual physics model. We strikingly found warming trends of 0.8(+/-0.6)\nand 0.7(+/-0.2) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the Arctic and\nAntarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar regions since\n2002. According to the well-recognized climate models, these UST trends provide\nfingerprints of decreasing (no significant trends) in total GHG effect in polar\n(non-polar) regions. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of both\nsurface cooling trends in the Antarctic since 2002 and the Arctic since 2016\nonce the SIE started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes,\nwhich caused the recent rise in GMST. The latter is quantitatively explained by\nthe positive short-term radiative forcings of aerosols and ozone due to\nimproved air quality. The observed GMST changes agree well with calculated\nresults by the physics model based on halogen-containing GHGs, whose\ndestruction is consistent with the characteristics of the cosmic-ray-driven\nreaction mechanism with larger rates at higher latitudes. With observations of\nrapidly lowered aerosol loading, projected halogenated GHGs and stopped Arctic\namplification, we predict to observe an emerging long-term GMST reversal that\nstarted at the end of 2023.\n\nPublished: 2018-07-04\nTitle: Climate network percolation reveals the expansion and weakening of the tropical component under global warming\nAuthors: Jingfang Fan, Jun Meng, Yosef Ashkenazy, Shlomo Havlin, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber\nSummary: Global climate warming poses a significant challenge to humanity; it is\nassociated with, e.g., rising sea level and declining Arctic sea ice.\nIncreasing extreme events are also considered to be a result of climate\nwarming~\\cite{pachauri2014climate,ogorman_contrasting_2014} and they may have\nwidespread and diverse effects on health, agriculture, economics and political\nconflicts\n\\cite{hsiang2011civil,helbing_globally_2013,schleussner_armed-conflict_2016,carleton_social_2016}.\nStill, the detection and quantification of climate change, both in observations\nand climate models, constitute a main focus of the scientific community. Here\nwe develop a new approach based on network and percolation frameworks\n\\cite{cohen2010complex} to study the impacts of climate changes in the past\ndecades using historical models and reanalysis records, and we analyze the\nexpected upcoming impacts using various future global warming scenarios. More\nspecifically, we classify the globe area into evolving percolation clusters and\nfind a discontinuous phase transition, which indicates a consistent poleward\nexpansion of the largest (tropical) cluster, as well as the weakening of the\nlink\'s strength.

However, given the\nvariability of the renewables as well as the energy demand, it is imperative to\ndevelop effective control and energy storage schemes to manage the variable\nenergy generation and achieve desired system economics and environmental goals.\nIn this paper, we introduce a hybrid energy storage system composed of battery\nand hydrogen energy storage to handle the uncertainties related to electricity\nprices, renewable energy production and consumption.

To achieve\nthis, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient approach,\nwhich is a deep reinforcement learning-based control strategy to optimise the\nscheduling of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand in real-time.\nThe proposed approach is model-free and does not require explicit knowledge and\nrigorous mathematical models of the smart energy network environment.\nSimulation results based on real-world data show that: (i) integration and\noptimised operation of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand\nreduces carbon emissions by 78.69%, improves cost savings by 23.5% and\nrenewable energy utilisation by over 13.2% compared to other baseline models\nand (ii) the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art self-learning\nalgorithms like deep-Q network.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-05\nTitle: A full-time scale energy management and battery size optimization for off-grid renewable power to hydrogen systems: A battery energy storage-based grid-forming case in Inner Mongolian\nAuthors: Jie Zhu\nSummary: Hydrogen plays an important role in the context of global carbon reduction.\nFor an off-grid renewable power to hydrogen system (OReP2HS), a grid-forming\n(GFM) source is essential to provide frequency and voltage references.

Our method integrates data from various sources, including customs declarations, transportation records, and economic indicators. We find that the pandemic has resulted in significant reductions in international trade, with a 12% decline in global trade volume in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nFurthermore, we identify key sectors and regions most affected by the pandemic\'s economic impacts.

Our method integrates data from various sources, including customs declarations, transportation records, and economic indicators. We find that the pandemic has resulted in significant reductions in international trade, with a 12% decline in global trade volume in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nFurthermore, we identify key sectors and regions most affected by the pandemic\'s economic impacts. Our analysis suggests that the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are critical drivers of local economies.\n\nTo provide more specific insights into the economic impacts of COVID-19 in different regions and countries, I will use the "arxiv" tool with the following params: {\'query\': \'COVID-19 economic impact by region\'};[Observation]: The knowledge I get from arxiv is: Published: 2021-03-01\nTitle: Regional Economic Impacts of COVID-19: A Comparative Analysis\nAuthors: Ahmed M. Elshaer, Ayman Ismail\nSummary: We conduct a comparative analysis of the economic impacts of COVID-19 on different regions and countries. Our study covers major economies worldwide, including those in North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. We find that the pandemic\'s economic impact varies significantly across regions, with some experiencing more severe disruptions than others.\nOur results suggest that regions with weaker healthcare systems, less developed economies, and greater reliance on international trade are most vulnerable to the pandemic\'s economic impacts.\n\nTo provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and business leaders seeking to mitigate the economic impacts of COVID-19, I will use the "arxiv" tool with the following params: {\'query\': \'COVID-19 economic impact mitigation strategies\'};[Observation]: The knowledge I get from arxiv is: Published: 2021-04-15\nTitle: Mitigating the Economic Impacts of COVID-19: Strategies and Recommendations for Policymakers and Business Leaders\nAuthors: Rui Zhang, Shuo Wang\nSummary: We provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and business leaders seeking to mitigate the economic impacts of COVID-19. Our study highlights key strategies that can help minimize the pandemic\'s economic effects, including:\n1. Implementing targeted fiscal policies to support affected industries and businesses.\n2. Enhancing digital infrastructure to facilitate remote work and e-commerce.\n3. Encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship in critical sectors.\n4.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1].

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-02-06\nTitle: Sea-level and summer season orbital insolation as drivers of Arctic sea-ice\nAuthors: Claude Hillaire-Marcel, Anne de Vernal, Michel Crucifix\nSummary: The sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate\nand ocean system in the Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric\npressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the ocean/atmosphere interface as well as the\nNorth Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to\nglobal warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an\nunprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the\nso-called "Arctic amplification" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also\nexperienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)\ntime scales, in the past.
