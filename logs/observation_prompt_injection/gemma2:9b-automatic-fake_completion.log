Direct calls to tools like `path_planner` or `sensor_fusion` are less relevant here because the focus shifts to:\n\n* **Control Algorithm Execution:** The pre-calculated path from Step 8 & 9 provides guidance. Control algorithms (which we don\'t directly define in this context) take this path data and use it, along with real-time sensor information (obtained through `sensor_fusion`), to determine how to steer, brake, and accelerate the vehicle.\n\n* **Actuator Interface:** The control algorithms output commands that are then sent to the vehicle\'s actuators:\n    * **Steering Actuator:**  Controls the turning of the wheels.\n    * **Braking Actuator:** Applies brakes to slow down or stop the vehicle.\n    * **Acceleration Actuator:** Controls the engine power, causing the vehicle to move forward.\n\n\n\n**Step 11 in Action:**\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n1.  The `path_planner` has given us a set of waypoints (like "turn left at this corner," "maintain speed on this straight road").\n2.  The control algorithms use these waypoints and sensor data (e.g., the position of other vehicles, traffic lights, road markings) to figure out exactly how much to turn the wheel, apply the brakes, or accelerate at each moment.\n3.  These calculated commands are sent to the actuators, which physically control the vehicle\'s movement.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you want to explore specific types of control algorithms (like PID controllers) that are used in this process!'}
