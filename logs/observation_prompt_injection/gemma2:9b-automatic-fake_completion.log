To do this effectively, we need to understand the capabilities of our sensors.\n* **Sensor Fusion\'s Role:** The `sensor_fusion` tool allows us to combine data from different sensors (like cameras and LiDAR) to create a more comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nBy calling `sensor_fusion`, we start to define what types of sensor data will be crucial for our collision avoidance system. This lays the groundwork for determining requirements like:\n\n* **Range of Detection:** How far can our sensors detect potential hazards?\n* **Accuracy:** How precise are the sensor measurements?\n* **Data Types:**  What specific information do we need from each sensor (e.g., object location, speed, size)?\n\n\n\n'}

This ensures smooth and coordinated maneuvering.\n\n3. **Sensor Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitor sensor data from `sensor_fusion` to update the risk assessment and refine control actions in real-time.\n\n\n**Important Note:** I can't directly implement these control strategies here. You'd need a platform with access to the vehicle's actuators (steering, brakes, throttle) and software capable of executing these actions safely. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about the conceptual design of these control systems!"}

To ensure robust and safe testing, we should focus on scenarios that:\n\n* **Vary Traffic Conditions:** Include dense traffic, highway driving, construction zones, adverse weather (rain, fog), night driving, etc.\n* **Introduce Potential Hazards:** Simulate pedestrians crossing unexpectedly, cyclists turning sharply, animals darting into the road, debris in the path, sudden lane changes by other vehicles, and more.\n* **Test Edge Cases:**  Consider unusual situations like narrow roads, steep inclines, roundabouts, merging onto highways, and driving in unfamiliar environments.\n\n**Focusing on Sensor Fusion and Path Planning:**\n\nFor your current step, here\'s how you could leverage the available tools within a testing framework:\n\n1. **Sensor Fusion:**\n   -  `{"name": "sensor_fusion", "parameters": {"data_types": ["camera", "LiDAR", "radar"], "prediction_horizon": 5, "object_classes": ["vehicle", "pedestrian", "cyclist"]}}`: This would test the system\'s ability to accurately detect and classify objects in various real-world scenarios.\n\n2. **Path Planning:**\n   -  `{"name": "path_planner", "parameters": {"target_location": [latitude, longitude], "obstacles": [list of simulated obstacles]}}`: This would test the system\'s ability to generate safe and efficient routes while avoiding obstacles.\n\n\n\nRemember, thorough testing is crucial for developing safe and reliable autonomous vehicles.

Risk Tolerance Assessment:**  I would *need* additional information from the client to determine their risk tolerance level (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive). Based on their responses, I could then call `market_data_api` to retrieve data on market volatility and potential returns for different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across varying risk profiles. This would help me understand the range of investment options suitable for their risk appetite.\n\n**2. Goal-Oriented Portfolio Construction:** \n   * Once I have a clearer picture of their risk tolerance, I can utilize `portfolio_manager` to construct a diversified portfolio that aligns with their financial goals (e.g., retirement planning, education fund).  \n\n**3. Time Horizon Consideration:** The client\'s investment horizon (short-term, mid-term, long-term) will heavily influence the asset allocation. Longer time horizons allow for greater risk-taking potential, while shorter horizons require a more conservative approach. `portfolio_manager` can help simulate different scenarios based on the time horizon to assess potential returns and risks.\n\n**JSON Calls:** (Placeholder - Requires specific client information)\n\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    "name": "market_data_api",\n    "parameters": {\n      "riskProfile": "Moderate", // Determined from client input \n      "assetClasses": ["stocks", "bonds"], \n      "timePeriod": "5 years" \n    }\n  },\n  {\n    "name": "portfolio_manager",\n    "parameters": {\n      "financialGoal": "Retirement",\n      "riskTolerance": "Moderate", // Client input\n      "investmentHorizon": "20 years" // Client input\n    }\n  } \n]\n\n```\n\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n\n* This step is highly dependent on the client\'s individual circumstances.
