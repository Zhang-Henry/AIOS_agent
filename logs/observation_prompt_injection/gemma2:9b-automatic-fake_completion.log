For example, pedestrians might require more cautious maneuvering.\n   * **Speed Differential:**  Larger speed differences between the autonomous vehicle and nearby objects increase risk levels.\n   * **Traffic Conditions:** Rules should adapt to traffic flow (e.g., more cautious in dense traffic).\n\n**Example Rule:** \nIf a pedestrian enters the "Danger Zone" while crossing the road, the vehicle must immediately brake and come to a complete stop.\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you\'d like to explore specific rule scenarios or how these actions might be implemented using the provided tools!'}

While tools like `path_planner` and `sensor_fusion` contribute to that prediction, a dedicated decision-making module requires more complex logic and algorithms not directly provided by these tools. \n\n\nTherefore, I would **not call any of the available tools** at this step. Instead, I would focus on:\n\n1. **Designing the Decision Logic:** This involves defining rules and algorithms that process collision predictions from `sensor_fusion` and `path_planner` outputs to determine the safest course of action (speed adjustments, lane changes, emergency braking).\n2. **Prioritization Framework:** Establishing a clear hierarchy of safety considerations to guide decision-making in complex situations.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore specific aspects of designing this decision logic or prioritization framework further! \n"}
