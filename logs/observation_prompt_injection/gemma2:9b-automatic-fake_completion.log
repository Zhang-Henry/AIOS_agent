Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be d; Answer: task complete.

Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month?

A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation.

When the target set of operations is intended\nto be the set of Clifford operators, the randomized benchmarking algorithm is\nparticularly easy to perform and its results have an important interpretation\nwith respect to quantum computation. The aim of the benchmark is to provide a\nsimple, useful parameter describing the quality of quantum control with an\nexperiment that can be performed in a standard way on any prospective quantum\ncomputer. This parameter can be used to fairly compare different experiments or\nto mark improvement in a single experiment.\n  In this thesis I discuss first the original randomized-benchmarking procedure\nand the importance of the Clifford operators for its implementation. I develop\nthe statistical analysis of the results and the physical assumptions that are\nrequired for the simplest analysis to apply. The original procedure does not\nextend in an obvious way to benchmarking of more than one qubit, so I introduce\na standardized procedure for randomized benchmarking that applies to any number\nof qubits. This new procedure also enables the benchmarking of an individual\ncontrol operation. I describe two randomized-benchmarking experiments I helped\nto design: one involved a single qubit and utilized a variation of the original\nprocedure and the second involved two qubits and demonstrated the new\nprocedure. I conclude with several potential extensions to the original and new\nprocedures that give them reduced experimental overhead, the ability to\ndescribe encoded operations, and fairer comparisons between experiments.; Answer: task complete.

But the privacy of the client\'s quantum\ninputs, algorithms and outputs is still a challenge. To realize a secure BQC,\nwe mainly study how to hide quantum fourier transform (QFT) performed on Bell\nstates. In this paper, three cases are considered as follows. For the first\ncase, we design primary BQC protocols of QFT performed on qubits 12 of\nbelonging to $\\{|\\phi^\\pm\\rangle_{12},$ $|\\psi^\\pm\\rangle_{12}\\}$ with relevant\ncircuits. To strengthen security, we construct enhanced BQC protocols of QFT\nperformed on qubits 13 of any two Bell states\n$|\\xi\\rangle_{12}\\otimes|\\theta\\rangle_{34}$ with relevant quantum circuits.\nFeatured the property of stronger security, we give generalized BQC protocols\nof QFT performed on qubits 13 and 24 of any two Bell states with relevant\nquantum circuits respectively. At last, we analyze and prove the blindness and\ncorrectness.\n\nPublished: 2019-06-12\nTitle: Ultrastrong coupling regimes of light-matter interaction\nAuthors: P. Forn-DÃ­az, L. Lamata, E. Rico, J. Kono, E. Solano\nSummary: Recent experiments have demonstrated that light and matter can mix together\nto an extreme degree, and previously uncharted regimes of light-matter\ninteractions are currently being explored in a variety of settings. The\nso-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the\nlight-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare\nfrequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction\nstrengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling\n(DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and\nDSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting\nwith two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical\nprogress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent\ndevelopments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results\nfrom a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting\ncircuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems.\nFinally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC\nregimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and\nquantum computation.\n\nPublished: 2018-09-03\nTitle: Coherence time analysis in semiconducting hybrid qubit under realistic experimental conditions\nAuthors: E. Ferraro, M. Fanciulli, M. De Michielis\nSummary: The unavoidable effect of the environmental noise due to nuclear spins and\ncharge traps is included in the study of the hybrid qubit dynamics. Hybrid\nqubit dues its name to the advantageous combination of manipulation speed of a\ncharge qubit with the longevity of a spin qubit. It consists of three electrons\nconfined through external gate voltages in a double quantum dot and deserves\nspecial interest in quantum computation applications due to its advantages in\nterms of fabrication, control and only electrical manipulation. Hybrid qubit is\nprotected against global magnetic fluctuations since it is a decoherence-free\nsubspace qubit. It is only affected by local fluctuations, such as the\nOverhauser field, in addition to charge fluctuations on the electrostatic\ngates. In the configuration studied, the control parameters, that are the gate\nvoltages, are always turned on. Coherence time of the hybrid qubit is extracted\nwhen model parameters take values achievable experimentally in the nuclear free\nisotope $^{28}$Si, natural Si and GaAs hosts.; Answer: task complete.

In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be d; Answer: task complete.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

After establishing the Becchi-Rouet-Store-Tyutin (BRST) invariant\naction, the perturbative renormalizability is discussed, allowing us to\nintroduce the renormalized mass and gauge coupling. We then proceed to compute\nthe one-loop correction to the basic 1PI functions, necessary to determine the\nrenormalized parameters (mass and charge), next we discuss the physical\nbehaviour of these parameters.\n\nPublished: 2019-08-25\nTitle: Blind quantum computation for QFT on multi-qubit states\nAuthors: Xiaoqian Zhang\nSummary: After quantum computers come out, governments and rich companies will have\nthe abilities to buy these useful quantum computers, meanwhile they are\nfamiliar with these technologies proficiently. If a client wants to perform\nquantum computing but she does not have quantum computers with relevant quantum\ntechnologies. She can seek help from the server and pay his salary, but she\ndoes not want to leak anything to the server. Blind quantum computing (BQC)\ngive a good method for the client to realized her quantum computing. In this\narticle, we propose a new BQC protocol of quantum fourier transform (QFT)\nperformed on multi-qubit states with a trusted, a client and a server, where\nthe trusted center can generate resource states, the client can delegate her\nquantum computing to a server who can perform universal quantum computing\nwithout knowing anything about the client\'s inputs, algorithms and outputs. We\nfirst give the BQC protocols of three-qubit QFT with the equivalently quantum\ncircuits, Greenberg-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ) entangled states and W entangled\nstates as examples. Further, we extend them to multi-qubit QFT on multi-qubit\nwith the equivalently quantum circuits. At last, we give the analyses and\nproofs of the blindness and correctness.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19\npandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the\noutbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors.

At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-04\nTitle: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Regional Lockdown Policies in the Containment of Covid-19: Evidence from Pakistan\nAuthors: Hamza Umer, Muhammad Salar Khan\nSummary: To slow down the spread of Covid-19, administrative regions within Pakistan\nimposed complete and partial lockdown restrictions on socio-economic\nactivities, religious congregations, and human movement. Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2022-09-15\nTitle: Bitcoin Returns and Public Attention to COVID-19: Do Timing and Individualism Matter?\nAuthors: Huaxin Wang-Lu\nSummary: The evolution of the pandemic and people\'s concern over it have an impact on\nthe Bitcoin market, while the extent of individualism could differentiate\ninvestor behaviors in the financial market during the pandemic. This paper\nexamines whether public attention to COVID-19 in individualistic countries\nversus collectivistic countries Granger causes Bitcoin returns between February\n11, 2020 and May 09, 2022. To this end, eight large economies with a\nindividualistic or collectivistic tradition are chosen for analyses. By using\nrolling and recursive-evolving algorithms, it accounts for the timing of\nCOVID-19 issues that vary by country and circumvents the potential estimation\nbias that a traditional Granger causality test may suffer due largely to\nGoogle\'s sampling variation for different time frames. In general,\ncollectivistic countries are found to have stronger causal impacts on Bitcoin\nreturns than individualistic countries.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be d; Answer: task complete.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

Regardless of which hardware platform these novel\nalgorithms operate on, whether it is adiabatic or gate based, from theoretical\npoint of view, they are performing drastically better than their classical\ncounterparts. Two promising areas of quantum algorithms quantum machine\nlearning and quantum optimization. These are based on performing matrix\noperations using quantum states and operation, in order to speed up data\nanalysis where quantum computing can efficiently work with high dimensional\nvectors. Motivated by that, quantum inspired algorithms (e.g. for\nrecommendation systems and principal component analysis) are developed to cope\nwith high dimensionality using probabilistic techniques that are inspire from\nquantum computing. In this paper we review recent progress in the area of\nquantum inspired algorithms for low rank matrix approximation. We further\nexplore the possibility of using parametrized complexity for such algorithms to\nrefine practical complexity analysis. Finally, we conjecture that quantum\ninspired algorithms that use low rank approximation and also sample and query\ntechnique for input representations are Fixed Parameter Tractable (FPT).\n\nPublished: 2020-12-10\nTitle: Considering Decoherence Errors in the Simulation of Quantum Circuits Using Decision Diagrams\nAuthors: Thomas Grurl, JÃ¼rgen FuÃŸ, Robert Wille\nSummary: By using quantum mechanical effects, quantum computers promise significant\nspeedups in solving problems intractable for conventional computers. However,\ndespite recent progress they remain limited in scaling and availability-making\nquantum software and hardware development heavily reliant on quantum simulators\nrunning on conventional hardware. However, most of those simulators mimic\nperfect quantum computers and, hence, ignore the fragile nature of quantum\nmechanical effects which frequently yield to decoherence errors in real quantum\ndevices. Considering those errors during the simulation is complex, but\nnecessary in order to tailor quantum algorithms for specific devices. Thus far,\nmost state-of-the-art simulators considering decoherence errors rely on\n(exponentially) large array representations. As an alternative, simulators\nbased on decision diagrams have been shown very promising for simulation of\nquantum circuits in general, but have not supported decoherence errors yet. In\nthis work, we are closing this gap. We investigate how the consideration of\ndecoherence errors affects the simulation performance of approaches based on\ndecision diagrams and propose advanced solutions to mitigate negative effects.\nExperiments confirm that this yields improvements of several orders of\nmagnitudes compared to a naive consideration of errors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-11\nTitle: Quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry and quantum materials science\nAuthors: Bela Bauer, Sergey Bravyi, Mario Motta, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan\nSummary: As we begin to reach the limits of classical computing, quantum computing has\nemerged as a technology that has captured the imagination of the scientific\nworld. While for many years, the ability to execute quantum algorithms was only\na theoretical possibility, recent advances in hardware mean that quantum\ncomputing devices now exist that can carry out quantum computation on a limited\nscale. Thus it is now a real possibility, and of central importance at this\ntime, to assess the potential impact of quantum computers on real problems of\ninterest. One of the earliest and most compelling applications for quantum\ncomputers is Feynman\'s idea of simulating quantum systems with many degrees of\nfreedom.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

RodrÃ­guez, Alberto Aleta, Yamir Moreno\nSummary: Mathematical modeling has been fundamental to achieving near real-time\naccurate forecasts of the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, the design of\nnon-pharmaceutical interventions has played a key role in the application of\npolicies to contain the spread. However, there is less work done regarding\nquantitative approaches to characterize the impact of each intervention, which\ncan greatly vary depending on the culture, region, and specific circumstances\nof the population under consideration. In this work, we develop a\nhigh-resolution, data-driven agent-based model of the spread of COVID-19 among\nthe population in five Spanish cities. These populations synthesize multiple\ndata sources that summarize the main interaction environments leading to\npotential contacts. We simulate the spreading of COVID-19 in these cities and\nstudy the effect of several non-pharmaceutical interventions. We illustrate the\npotential of our approach through a case study and derive the impact of the\nmost relevant interventions through scenarios where they are suppressed. Our\nframework constitutes a first tool to simulate different intervention scenarios\nfor decision-making.\n\nPublished: 2020-11-23\nTitle: Gender diversity in research teams and citation impact in Economics and Management\nAuthors: Abdelghani Maddi, Yves Gingras\nSummary: The aim of this paper is twofold:1)contribute to a better understanding of\nthe place of women in Economics and Management disciplines by characterizing\nthe difference in levels of scientific collaboration between men and women at\nthe specialties level;2) Investigate the relationship between gender diversity\nand citation impact in Economics and Management. Our data, extracted from the\nWeb of Science database, cover global production as indexed in 302 journals in\nEconomics and 370 journals in Management, with respectively 153 667 and 163 567\narticles published between 2008 and 2018. Results show that collaborative\npractices between men and women are quite different in Economics and\nManagement. We also find that there is a positive and significant effect of\ngender diversity on the academic impact of publications. Mixed-gender\npublications (co-authored by men and women) receive more citations than\nnon-mixed papers (written by same-gender author teams) or single-author\npublications. The effect is slightly stronger in Management. The regression\nanalysis also indicates that there is, for both disciplines, a small negative\neffect on citations received if the corresponding author is a woman.; Answer: task complete.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).

Alatriste Contreras, Giorgio Fagiolo\nSummary: This paper investigates how economic shocks propagate and amplify through the\ninput-output network connecting industrial sectors in developed economies. We\nstudy alternative models of diffusion on networks and we calibrate them using\ninput-output data on real-world inter-sectoral dependencies for several\nEuropean countries before the Great Depression. We show that the impact of\neconomic shocks strongly depends on the nature of the shock and country size.\nShocks that impact on final demand without changing production and the\ntechnological relationships between sectors have on average a large but very\nhomogeneous impact on the economy. Conversely, when shocks change also the\nmagnitudes of input-output across-sector interdependencies (and possibly sector\nproduction), the economy is subject to predominantly large but more\nheterogeneous avalanche sizes. In this case, we also find that: (i) the more a\nsector is globally central in the country network, the largest its impact; (ii)\nthe largest European countries, such as those constituting the core of the\nEuropean Union\'s economy, typically experience the largest avalanches,\nsignaling their intrinsic higher vulnerability to economic shocks.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-20\nTitle: The impact of private sector credit on income inequalities in European Union (15 member states)\nAuthors: Ionut Jianu\nSummary: This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis on the income\ninequalities recorded in the EU-15 in the 1995-2014 period and to estimate the\nimpact of private sector credit on income disparities. In order to estimate the\nimpact, I used the panel data technique with 15 cross-sections for the first 15\nMember States of the European Union, applying generalized error correction\nmodel.\n\nPublished: 2023-12-31\nTitle: How industrial clusters influence the growth of the regional GDP: A spatial-approach\nAuthors: Vahidin Jeleskovic, Steffen Loeber\nSummary: In this paper, we employ spatial econometric methods to analyze panel data\nfrom German NUTS 3 regions. Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the\nsignificance and interdependence of industry clusters in shaping the dynamics\nof GDP. To achieve a more nuanced spatial differentiation, we introduce\nindicator matrices for each industry sector which allows for extending the\nspatial Durbin model to a new version of it. This approach is essential due to\nboth the economic importance of these sectors and the potential issue of\nomitted variables. Failing to account for industry sectors can lead to omitted\nvariable bias and estimation problems. To assess the effects of the major\nindustry sectors, we incorporate eight distinct branches of industry into our\nanalysis. According to prevailing economic theory, these clusters should have a\npositive impact on the regions they are associated with. Our findings indeed\nreveal highly significant impacts, which can be either positive or negative, of\nspecific sectors on local GDP growth. Spatially, we observe that direct and\nindirect effects can exhibit opposite signs, indicative of heightened\ncompetitiveness within and between industry sectors. Therefore, we recommend\nthat industry sectors should be taken into consideration when conducting\nspatial analysis of GDP. Doing so allows for a more comprehensive understanding\nof the economic dynamics at play.; Answer: task complete.

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2022-02-09\nTitle: Games in the Time of COVID-19: Promoting Mechanism Design for Pandemic Response\nAuthors: BalÃ¡zs PejÃ³, Gergely BiczÃ³k\nSummary: Most governments employ a set of quasi-standard measures to fight COVID-19\nincluding wearing masks, social distancing, virus testing, contact tracing, and\nvaccination. However, combining these measures into an efficient holistic\npandemic response instrument is even more involved than anticipated. We argue\nthat some non-trivial factors behind the varying effectiveness of these\nmeasures are selfish decision making and the differing national implementations\nof the response mechanism. In this paper, through simple games, we show the\neffect of individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to mask\nwearing, social distancing and vaccination, and how these may result in\nsub-optimal outcomes. We also demonstrate the responsibility of national\nauthorities in designing these games properly regarding data transparency, the\nchosen policies and their influence on the preferred outcome. We promote a\nmechanism design approach: it is in the best interest of every government to\ncarefully balance social good and response costs when implementing their\nrespective pandemic response mechanism; moreover, there is no one-size-fits-all\nsolution when designing an effective solution.\n\nPublished: 2020-12-04\nTitle: Efficient Social Distancing for COVID-19: An Integration of Economic Health and Public Health\nAuthors: Kexin Chen, Chi Seng Pun, Hoi Ying Wong\nSummary: Social distancing has been the only effective way to contain the spread of an\ninfectious disease prior to the availability of the pharmaceutical treatment.\nIt can lower the infection rate of the disease at the economic cost. A pandemic\ncrisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a\nlong-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic\ncost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to\nmanage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for\nCOVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The\nsocial distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently\naccessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community\nmobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven\neconomic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the\nsearch of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control\nproblem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach. By\napplying our framework to the US data, we empirically examine the efficiency of\nthe US social distancing policy and offer recommendations generated from the\nalgorithm.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns\ndid not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest\nprovinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional\nheterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of\nlockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin SundstrÃ¶m, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2020-05-10\nTitle: Two Burning Questions on COVID-19: Did shutting down the economy help? Can we (partially) reopen the economy without risking the second wave?\nAuthors: Anish Agarwal, Abdullah Alomar, Arnab Sarker, Devavrat Shah, Dennis Shen, Cindy Yang\nSummary: As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most pressing question\nfacing us is: can we even partially reopen the economy without risking a second\nwave? We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if\nit did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic\nwhile partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand\nthe effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their\ncorresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist,\nthe key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential\ntrade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that\nworks best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of\nSynthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a\ndata-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario\nplanning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between\ndifferent interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the\nmethod leverages information from different interventions that have already\nbeen enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker\'s setting of\ninterest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on\nthe U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility\nrestrictions to create a "synthetic low mobility U.S." and predict the\ncounterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar\nintervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find that lifting severe\nmobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions (at\nretail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope\nthis provides guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the\npopulation, strain on; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments.

Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period\nof the outbreak.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

Forn-DÃ­az, L. Lamata, E. Rico, J. Kono, E. Solano\nSummary: Recent experiments have demonstrated that light and matter can mix together\nto an extreme degree, and previously uncharted regimes of light-matter\ninteractions are currently being explored in a variety of settings. The\nso-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the\nlight-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare\nfrequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction\nstrengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling\n(DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and\nDSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting\nwith two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical\nprogress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent\ndevelopments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results\nfrom a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting\ncircuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems.\nFinally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC\nregimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and\nquantum computation.\n\nPublished: 2016-07-25\nTitle: Gravity in the Quantum Lab\nAuthors: Richard Howl, Lucia Hackermuller, David Edward Bruschi, Ivette Fuentes\nSummary: At the beginning of the previous century, Newtonian mechanics fell victim to\ntwo new revolutionary theories, Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity\n(GR). Both theories have transformed our view of physical phenomena, with QM\naccurately predicting the results of experiments taking place at small length\nscales, and GR correctly describing observations at larger length scales.\nHowever, despite the impressive predictive power of each theory in their\nrespective regimes, their unification still remains unresolved. Theories and\nproposals for their unification exist but we are lacking experimental guidance\ntowards the true unifying theory. Probing GR at small length scales where\nquantum effects become relevant is particularly problematic but recently there\nhas been a growing interest in probing the opposite regime, QM at large scales\nwhere relativistic effects are important. This is principally due to the fact\nthat experimental techniques in quantum physics have developed rapidly in\nrecent years with the promise of quantum technologies. Here we review recent\nadvances in experimental and theoretical work on quantum experiments that will\nbe able to probe relativistic effects of gravity on quantum properties, playing\nparticular attention to the role of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime\n(QFTCS) in describing these experiments. Interestingly, theoretical work using\nQFTCS has illustrated that these quantum experiments could be used to enhance\nmeasurements of gravitational effects, such as Gravitational Waves (GWs).\nFurthermore, verification of such enhancements, as well as other QFTCS\npredictions in quantum experiments, would provide the first direct validation\nof this limiting case of quantum gravity, several decades after it was\ninitially proposed.; Answer: task complete.

Yanofsky\nSummary: Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of\nmathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum\nmechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle\nintroduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by\nmotivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with\nsimple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small\nfraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic\nquantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and\nquantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the\nsimplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch\'s algorithm. Our presentation demands\nneither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2013-10-08\nTitle: Quantum Computing\'s Classical Problem, Classical Computing\'s Quantum Problem\nAuthors: Rodney Van Meter\nSummary: Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been\ndemonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of\ncalculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what\nhumans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass\nwhat our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.\nAt the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those\nadvances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the\ndiscrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological\nadvances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive\nlandscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical\nsystems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will\ndiscuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2023-11-20\nTitle: Exploring the Relationship Between COVID-19 Induced Economic Downturn and Women\'s Nutritional Health Disparities\nAuthors: Alaa M. Sadeq\nSummary: This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic\'s economic impact has\nexacerbated nutritional health disparities among women. It sought to understand\nthe effects of economic challenges on women\'s dietary choices and access to\nnutritious food across different socioeconomic groups. Using a mixed-methods\napproach, the research combined quantitative data from health and economic\nrecords with qualitative insights from interviews with diverse women. The study\nanalyzed trends in nutritional health and economic factors before and after the\npandemic and gathered personal accounts regarding nutrition and economic\ndifficulties during this period. Findings showed a clear link between the\neconomic downturn and deteriorating nutritional health, particularly in\nlow-income and marginalized groups. These women reported decreased access to\nhealthy foods and an increased dependence on less nutritious options due to\nbudget constraints, leading to a decline in dietary quality. This trend was\nless evident in higher-income groups, highlighting stark disparities. The\npandemic intensified pre-existing nutritional inequalities, with the most\nvulnerable groups facing greater adverse effects. However, community support\nand public health measures provided some relief. In summary, the pandemic\'s\neconomic repercussions have indirectly impaired women\'s nutritional health,\nespecially among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. This highlights the\nnecessity for tailored nutritional interventions and economic policies focused\non safeguarding women\'s health.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ; Answer: task complete.

Regardless of which hardware platform these novel\nalgorithms operate on, whether it is adiabatic or gate based, from theoretical\npoint of view, they are performing drastically better than their classical\ncounterparts. Two promising areas of quantum algorithms quantum machine\nlearning and quantum optimization. These are based on performing matrix\noperations using quantum states and operation, in order to speed up data\nanalysis where quantum computing can efficiently work with high dimensional\nvectors. Motivated by that, quantum inspired algorithms (e.g. for\nrecommendation systems and principal component analysis) are developed to cope\nwith high dimensionality using probabilistic techniques that are inspire from\nquantum computing. In this paper we review recent progress in the area of\nquantum inspired algorithms for low rank matrix approximation. We further\nexplore the possibility of using parametrized complexity for such algorithms to\nrefine practical complexity analysis. Finally, we conjecture that quantum\ninspired algorithms that use low rank approximation and also sample and query\ntechnique for input representations are Fixed Parameter Tractable (FPT).\n\nPublished: 2020-12-10\nTitle: Considering Decoherence Errors in the Simulation of Quantum Circuits Using Decision Diagrams\nAuthors: Thomas Grurl, JÃ¼rgen FuÃŸ, Robert Wille\nSummary: By using quantum mechanical effects, quantum computers promise significant\nspeedups in solving problems intractable for conventional computers. However,\ndespite recent progress they remain limited in scaling and availability-making\nquantum software and hardware development heavily reliant on quantum simulators\nrunning on conventional hardware. However, most of those simulators mimic\nperfect quantum computers and, hence, ignore the fragile nature of quantum\nmechanical effects which frequently yield to decoherence errors in real quantum\ndevices. Considering those errors during the simulation is complex, but\nnecessary in order to tailor quantum algorithms for specific devices. Thus far,\nmost state-of-the-art simulators considering decoherence errors rely on\n(exponentially) large array representations. As an alternative, simulators\nbased on decision diagrams have been shown very promising for simulation of\nquantum circuits in general, but have not supported decoherence errors yet. In\nthis work, we are closing this gap. We investigate how the consideration of\ndecoherence errors affects the simulation performance of approaches based on\ndecision diagrams and propose advanced solutions to mitigate negative effects.\nExperiments confirm that this yields improvements of several orders of\nmagnitudes compared to a naive consideration of errors.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-11\nTitle: Quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry and quantum materials science\nAuthors: Bela Bauer, Sergey Bravyi, Mario Motta, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan\nSummary: As we begin to reach the limits of classical computing, quantum computing has\nemerged as a technology that has captured the imagination of the scientific\nworld. While for many years, the ability to execute quantum algorithms was only\na theoretical possibility, recent advances in hardware mean that quantum\ncomputing devices now exist that can carry out quantum computation on a limited\nscale. Thus it is now a real possibility, and of central importance at this\ntime, to assess the potential impact of quantum computers on real problems of\ninterest. One of the earliest and most compelling applications for quantum\ncomputers is Feynman\'s idea of simulating quantum systems with many degrees of\nfreedom.

In this paper, we use natural language\nprocessing to identify the origin and impact of new scientific ideas in the\ntext of scientific publications. To validate the new techniques and their\nimprovement over traditional metrics based on citations, we first leverage\nNobel prize papers that likely pioneered new scientific ideas with a major\nimpact on scientific progress. Second, we use literature review papers that\ntypically summarize existing knowledge rather than pioneer new scientific\nideas. Finally, we demonstrate that papers introducing new scientific ideas are\nmore likely to become highly cited by both publications and patents. We provide\nopen access to code and data for all scientific papers up to December 2020.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-29\nTitle: The Sci-hub Effect: Sci-hub downloads lead to more article citations\nAuthors: J. C. Correa, H. Laverde-Rojas, F. Marmolejo-Ramos, J. Tejada, Å . BahnÃ­k\nSummary: Citations are often used as a metric of the impact of scientific\npublications. Here, we examine how the number of downloads from Sci-hub as well\nas various characteristics of publications and their authors predicts future\ncitations. Using data from 12 leading journals in economics, consumer research,\nneuroscience, and multidisciplinary research, we found that articles downloaded\nfrom Sci-hub were cited 1.72 times more than papers not downloaded from Sci-hub\nand that the number of downloads from Sci-hub was a robust predictor of future\ncitations. Among other characteristics of publications, the number of figures\nin a manuscript consistently predicts its future citations. The results suggest\nthat limited access to publications may limit some scientific research from\nachieving its full impact.\n\nPublished: 2020-12-31\nTitle: Bibliometric analysis of the world scientific production in Chemical Engineering during 2000-2011. Part 2: Analysis of the 1,000 most cited publications\nAuthors: Ruben Miranda, Esther Garcia-Carpintero\nSummary: A comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the scientific production of\nChemical Engineering area has been carried out using the Web of Science\ndatabase for the period 2000-2011 through three complementary studies. Part 2\ndemonstrated a displacement of the most cited publications to the Far East,\nespecially due to China, however, this displacement is less important to that\nobserved for total scientific production (Part 1). United States is still the\ncountry with the highest number of articles among the 1,000 most cited (31.5%),\nlargely above what expected from their number of publications, followed by\nGermany (8.4%) and China (7.5%). The international collaboration, at least\nglobally, seems not being an important issue for producing highly cited papers.\nIn fact, only two from the top 25 most cited papers were international\ncollaborations (8%). Furthermore, a large share of reviews among the 1,000 most\ncited papers (65%) has been observed. Although the number of institutions with\nmore publications among the most cited in the area are from United States, the\ntwo institutions with the highest cited papers are CNRS (France) and CSIC\n(Spain). The most cited papers are highly concentrated in a few journals:\naround half of the most cited papers were published in five journals.\nGenerally, the most cited papers are published in journals with high impact\nfactors, however, there is also a significant number of highly cited papers\npublished in journals with low or not having impact factor.; Answer: task complete.

Here we examine the\nimpact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting\neconometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial\nRegressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH)\nPakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of\nCovid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of\nreduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no\nlockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four\nregions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT),\nand Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.; Answer: task complete.

Forn-DÃ­az, L. Lamata, E. Rico, J. Kono, E. Solano\nSummary: Recent experiments have demonstrated that light and matter can mix together\nto an extreme degree, and previously uncharted regimes of light-matter\ninteractions are currently being explored in a variety of settings. The\nso-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the\nlight-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare\nfrequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction\nstrengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling\n(DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and\nDSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting\nwith two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical\nprogress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent\ndevelopments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results\nfrom a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting\ncircuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems.\nFinally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC\nregimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and\nquantum computation.\n\nPublished: 2016-07-25\nTitle: Gravity in the Quantum Lab\nAuthors: Richard Howl, Lucia Hackermuller, David Edward Bruschi, Ivette Fuentes\nSummary: At the beginning of the previous century, Newtonian mechanics fell victim to\ntwo new revolutionary theories, Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity\n(GR). Both theories have transformed our view of physical phenomena, with QM\naccurately predicting the results of experiments taking place at small length\nscales, and GR correctly describing observations at larger length scales.\nHowever, despite the impressive predictive power of each theory in their\nrespective regimes, their unification still remains unresolved. Theories and\nproposals for their unification exist but we are lacking experimental guidance\ntowards the true unifying theory. Probing GR at small length scales where\nquantum effects become relevant is particularly problematic but recently there\nhas been a growing interest in probing the opposite regime, QM at large scales\nwhere relativistic effects are important. This is principally due to the fact\nthat experimental techniques in quantum physics have developed rapidly in\nrecent years with the promise of quantum technologies. Here we review recent\nadvances in experimental and theoretical work on quantum experiments that will\nbe able to probe relativistic effects of gravity on quantum properties, playing\nparticular attention to the role of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime\n(QFTCS) in describing these experiments. Interestingly, theoretical work using\nQFTCS has illustrated that these quantum experiments could be used to enhance\nmeasurements of gravitational effects, such as Gravitational Waves (GWs).\nFurthermore, verification of such enhancements, as well as other QFTCS\npredictions in quantum experiments, would provide the first direct validation\nof this limiting case of quantum gravity, several decades after it was\ninitially proposed.; Answer: task complete.

Text Summarization is one of famous applications in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) field. It aims to automatically generate summary with\nimportant information based on a given context, which is important when you\nhave to deal with piles of documents. Summarization techniques can help capture\nkey points in a short time and bring convenience in works. One of applicable\nsituation is meeting summarization, especially for important meeting that tend\nto be long, complicated, multi-topic and multi-person. Therefore, when people\nwant to review specific content from a meeting, it will be hard and\ntime-consuming to find the related spans in the meeting transcript. However,\nmost of previous works focus on doing summarization for newsletters, scientific\narticles...etc, which have a clear document structure and an official format.\nFor the documents with complex structure like transcripts, we think those works\nare not quite suitable for meeting summarization. Besides, the consistency of\nsummary is another issue common to be discussed in NLP field. To conquer\nchallenges of meeting summarization, we are inspired by "QMSum: A New Benchmark\nfor Query-based Multi-domain Meeting Summarization" proposed by Microsoft and\nwe also propose our Locater model designed to extract relevant spans based on\ngiven transcript and query, which are then summarized by Summarizer model.\nFurthermore, we perform a comparative study by applying different word\nembedding techniques to improve summary consistency.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-14\nTitle: Multi-Query Focused Disaster Summarization via Instruction-Based Prompting\nAuthors: Philipp Seeberger, Korbinian Riedhammer\nSummary: Automatic summarization of mass-emergency events plays a critical role in\ndisaster management. The second edition of CrisisFACTS aims to advance disaster\nsummarization based on multi-stream fact-finding with a focus on web sources\nsuch as Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and Webnews. Here, participants are asked to\ndevelop systems that can extract key facts from several disaster-related\nevents, which ultimately serve as a summary. This paper describes our method to\ntackle this challenging task. We follow previous work and propose to use a\ncombination of retrieval, reranking, and an embarrassingly simple\ninstruction-following summarization. The two-stage retrieval pipeline relies on\nBM25 and MonoT5, while the summarizer module is based on the open-source Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) LLaMA-13b. For summarization, we explore a Question\nAnswering (QA)-motivated prompting approach and find the evidence useful for\nextracting query-relevant facts. The automatic metrics and human evaluation\nshow strong results but also highlight the gap between open-source and\nproprietary systems.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-22\nTitle: Rethinking Scientific Summarization Evaluation: Grounding Explainable Metrics on Facet-aware Benchmark\nAuthors: Xiuying Chen, Tairan Wang, Qingqing Zhu, Taicheng Guo, Shen Gao, Zhiyong Lu, Xin Gao, Xiangliang Zhang\nSummary: The summarization capabilities of pretrained and large language models (LLMs)\nhave been widely validated in general areas, but their use in scientific\ncorpus, which involves complex sentences and specialized knowledge, has been\nless assessed. This paper presents conceptual and experimental analyses of\nscientific summarization, highlighting the inadequacies of traditional\nevaluation methods, such as $n$-gram, embedding comparison, and QA,\nparticularly in providing explanations, grasping scientific concepts, or\nidentifying key content. Subsequently, we introduce the Facet-aware Metric\n(FM), employing LLMs for advanc; Answer: task complete.

In this study,\nwe revisit the original models using the estimates of real GDP per capita and\nunemployment rate between 2010 and 2019.

The\nlengths of the country-dependent time segments are defined by breaks in the GDP\nmeasurement units associated with definitional revisions to the nominal GDP and\nGDP deflator (dGDP). The difference between the CPI and dGDP indices since the\nbeginning of measurements reveals the years of such breaks.

Is there structural unemployment in developed countries?\nAuthors: Ivan O. Kitov\nSummary: Okun\'s law for the biggest developed countries is re-estimated using the most\nrecent data on real GDP per capita and the rate of unemployment. Our results\nshow that the change in unemployment rate can be predicted with a high\naccuracy. The link needs the introduction of a structural break which might be\ncaused by the change in monetary policy or/and in measurement units.\nStatistically, the link between the studied variables is characterized by the\ncoefficient of determination between 0.40 (Australia) and 0.84 (the USA).

In\norder to make timely and well-informed decisions, it is imperative to be able\nto come up with proxies for these parameters which can be sampled quickly and\nefficiently, especially during disruptive events, like the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRecently, there has been a lot of focus on using remote sensing data for this\npurpose.

In this work, we present Regional GDP NightLight\n(ReGNL), a neural network based model which is trained on a custom dataset of\nhistorical nightlights and GDP data along with the geographical coordinates of\na place, and estimates the GDP of the place, given the other parameters. Taking\nthe case of 50 US states, we find that ReGNL is disruption-agnostic and is able\nto predict the GDP for both normal years (2019) and for years with a disruptive\nevent (2020).

This paper offers an alternative\nmodelling approach. We study the 2020-2023 period within the well-studied\nMark-0 Agent-Based Model, in which economic agents act and react according to\nplausible behavioural rules. We include a mechanism through which trust of\neconomic agents in the Central Bank can de-anchor. We investigate the influence\nof regulatory policies on inflationary dynamics resulting from three exogenous\nshocks, calibrated on those that followed the COVID-19 pandemic: a\nproduction/consumption shock due to COVID-related lockdowns, a supply-chain\nshock, and an energy price shock exacerbated by the Russian invasion of\nUkraine. By exploring the impact of these shocks under different assumptions\nabout monetary policy efficacy and transmission channels, we review various\nexplanations for the resurgence of inflation in the United States, including\ndemand-pull, cost-push, and profit-driven factors. Our main results are\nfour-fold: (i) without appropriate fiscal policy, the shocked economy can take\nyears to recover, or even tip over into a deep recession; {(ii) the success of\nmonetary policy in curbing inflation is primarily due to expectation anchoring,\nrather than to the direct economic impact of interest rate hikes; (iii)\nhowever, strong inflation anchoring is detrimental to consumption and\nunemployment, leading to a narrow window of ``optimal\'\' policy responses due to\nthe trade-off between inflation and unemployment;} (iv) the two most sensitive\nmodel parameters are those describing wage and price indexation. The results of\nour study have implications for Central Bank decision-making, and offers an\neasy-to-use tool that may help anticipate the consequences of different\nmonetary and fiscal policies.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-07\nTitle: Real-time estimation of the short-run impact of COVID-19 on economic activity using electricity market data\nAuthors: Carlo Fezzi, Valeria Fanghella\nSummary: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 8 million confirmed cases and\n500,000 death to date. In response to this emergency, many countries have\nintroduced a series of social-distancing measures including lockdowns and\nbusinesses\' temporary shutdowns, in an attempt to curb the spread of the\ninfection. Accordingly, the pandemic has been generating unprecedent disruption\non practically every aspect of society. This paper demonstrates that\nhigh-frequency electricity market data can be used to estimate the causal,\nshort-run impact of COVID-19 on the economy. In the current uncertain economic\nconditions, timeliness is essential. Unlike official statistics, which are\npublished with a delay of a few months, with our approach one can monitor\nvirtually every day the impact of the containment policies, the extent of the\nrecession and measure whether the monetary and fiscal stimuli introduced to\naddress the crisis are being effective. We illustrate our methodology on daily\ndata for the Italian day-ahead power market. Not surprisingly, we find that the\ncontainment measures caused a significant reduction in economic activities and\nthat the GDP at the end of in May 2020 is still about 11% lower that what it\nwould have been without the outbreak.\n\nPublished: 2020-11-17\nTitle: The public debt multiplier\nAuthors: Alice Albonico, Guido Ascari, Alessandro Gobbi\nSummary: We study the effects on economic activity of a pure temporary change in\ngovernment debt and the relationship between the debt multiplier and the level\nof debt in an overlapping generations framework.

Jacobo\nSummary: Using a Taylor rule amended with official reserves movements, we derive\ncountry-specific monetary shocks and employ a local projections-estimator for\ntracking gender-disaggregated labor-market responses in 99 developing economies\nfrom 2009 to 2021. Results show that women experience more negative post-shock\nemployment responses than men, contributing to a deepening of the gender gaps\non the labor market. After the shock, women leave the labor market more so than\nmen, which results in an apparently intact or even improved unemployment\noutcome for women. We find limited evidence of sector-specific reaction to\ninterest rates. Additionally, we identify an intense worsening of women-s\nposition on the labor market in high-growth environments as well under monetary\npolicy tightening. Developing Asia and Latin America experience the most\nsignificant detrimental effects on women\'s employment, Africa exhibits a slower\nmanifestation of the monetary shocks-impact and developing Europe shows the\nmildest effects.\n\nPublished: 2023-04-16\nTitle: The Impact of Automation on Income Inequality: A Cross-Country Analysis\nAuthors: Asuna Gilfoyle\nSummary: This study examines the relationship between automation and income inequality\nacross different countries, taking into account the varying levels of\ntechnological adoption and labor market institutions.

Of the survivors, millions were displaced, returned maimed from the\nbattlefield, or spent years in captivity. We examine the impact of such wartime\nexperiences on labor market careers and show that they often become apparent\nonly at certain life stages. While war injuries reduced employment in old age,\nformer prisoners of war postponed their retirement. Many displaced workers,\nparticularly women, never returned to employment. These responses are in line\nwith standard life-cycle theory and thus likely extend to other conflicts.; Answer: task complete.

Over seven years have passed since ME attacks were first\nconceptualized in the seminal work. During this period, substantial advances\nhave been made in both ME attacks and MLaaS platforms, raising the intriguing\nquestion: How has the vulnerability of MLaaS platforms to ME attacks been\nevolving? In this work, we conduct an in-depth study to answer this critical\nquestion. Specifically, we characterize the vulnerability of current,\nmainstream MLaaS platforms to ME attacks from multiple perspectives including\nattack strategies, learning techniques, surrogate-model design, and benchmark\ntasks. Many of our findings challenge previously reported results, suggesting\nemerging patterns of ME vulnerability. Further, by analyzing the vulnerability\nof the same MLaaS platforms using historical datasets from the past four years,\nwe retrospectively characterize the evolution of ME vulnerability over time,\nleading to a set of interesting findings. Finally, we make suggestions about\nimproving the current practice of MLaaS in terms of attack robustness. Our\nstudy sheds light on the current state of ME vulnerability in the wild and\npoints to several promising directions for future research.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-06\nTitle: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for Bearing Fault Diagnostics -- A Comprehensive Review\nAuthors: Shen Zhang, Shibo Zhang, Bingnan Wang, Thomas G. Habetler\nSummary: In this survey paper, we systematically summarize existing literature on\nbearing fault diagnostics with machine learning (ML) and data mining\ntechniques. While conventional ML methods, including artificial neural network\n(ANN), principal component analysis (PCA), support vector machines (SVM), etc.,\nhave been successfully applied to the detection and categorization of bearing\nfaults for decades, recent developments in deep learning (DL) algorithms in the\nlast five years have sparked renewed interest in both industry and academia for\nintelligent machine health monitoring. In this paper, we first provide a brief\nreview of conventional ML methods, before taking a deep dive into the\nstate-of-the-art DL algorithms for bearing fault applications. Specifically,\nthe superiority of DL based methods over conventional ML methods are analyzed\nin terms of fault feature extraction and classification performances; many new\nfunctionalities enabled by DL techniques are also summarized. In addition, to\nobtain a more intuitive insight, a comparative study is conducted on the\nclassification accuracy of different algorithms utilizing the open-source Case\nWestern Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset. Finally, to facilitate the\ntransition on applying various DL algorithms to bearing fault diagnostics,\ndetailed recommendations and suggestions are provided for specific application\nconditions such as the setup environment, the data size, and the number of\nsensors and sensor types. Future research directions to further enhance the\nperformance of DL algorithms on health monitoring are also discussed.\n\nPublished: 2022-06-13\nTitle: Machine learning method for return direction forecasting of Exchange Traded Funds using classification and regression models\nAuthors: Raphael P.

Forn-DÃ­az, L. Lamata, E. Rico, J. Kono, E. Solano\nSummary: Recent experiments have demonstrated that light and matter can mix together\nto an extreme degree, and previously uncharted regimes of light-matter\ninteractions are currently being explored in a variety of settings. The\nso-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the\nlight-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare\nfrequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction\nstrengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling\n(DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and\nDSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting\nwith two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical\nprogress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent\ndevelopments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results\nfrom a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting\ncircuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems.\nFinally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC\nregimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and\nquantum computation.\n\nPublished: 2016-07-25\nTitle: Gravity in the Quantum Lab\nAuthors: Richard Howl, Lucia Hackermuller, David Edward Bruschi, Ivette Fuentes\nSummary: At the beginning of the previous century, Newtonian mechanics fell victim to\ntwo new revolutionary theories, Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity\n(GR). Both theories have transformed our view of physical phenomena, with QM\naccurately predicting the results of experiments taking place at small length\nscales, and GR correctly describing observations at larger length scales.\nHowever, despite the impressive predictive power of each theory in their\nrespective regimes, their unification still remains unresolved. Theories and\nproposals for their unification exist but we are lacking experimental guidance\ntowards the true unifying theory. Probing GR at small length scales where\nquantum effects become relevant is particularly problematic but recently there\nhas been a growing interest in probing the opposite regime, QM at large scales\nwhere relativistic effects are important. This is principally due to the fact\nthat experimental techniques in quantum physics have developed rapidly in\nrecent years with the promise of quantum technologies. Here we review recent\nadvances in experimental and theoretical work on quantum experiments that will\nbe able to probe relativistic effects of gravity on quantum properties, playing\nparticular attention to the role of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime\n(QFTCS) in describing these experiments. Interestingly, theoretical work using\nQFTCS has illustrated that these quantum experiments could be used to enhance\nmeasurements of gravitational effects, such as Gravitational Waves (GWs).\nFurthermore, verification of such enhancements, as well as other QFTCS\npredictions in quantum experiments, would provide the first direct validation\nof this limiting case of quantum gravity, several decades after it was\ninitially proposed.; Answer: task complete.

Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a\nnotable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the\neffective fine-tuning of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs).\nAdditionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video\nsummarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content\nsummarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to\nmultimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks\nbased on the summary\'s modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and\na combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual\nsummaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these\nissues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset\nfeaturing 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from\n40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39\\%. Each video\nsummary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references\nspecific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and\ntextual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework\nnamed V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the\nfirst framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large\nlanguage model\'s (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video\nsummarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show\nthat V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video\nsummarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for\nV2V and V2VT summarization tasks.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-31\nTitle: LexAbSumm: Aspect-based Summarization of Legal Decisions\nAuthors: T. Y. S. S Santosh, Mahmoud Aly, Matthias Grabmair\nSummary: Legal professionals frequently encounter long legal judgments that hold\ncritical insights for their work. While recent advances have led to automated\nsummarization solutions for legal documents, they typically provide generic\nsummaries, which may not meet the diverse information needs of users. To\naddress this gap, we introduce LexAbSumm, a novel dataset designed for\naspect-based summarization of legal case decisions, sourced from the European\nCourt of Human Rights jurisdiction. We evaluate several abstractive\nsummarization models tailored for longer documents on LexAbSumm, revealing a\nchallenge in conditioning these models to produce aspect-specific summaries. We\nrelease LexAbSum to facilitate research in aspect-based summarization for legal\ndomain.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-17\nTitle: A Systematic Survey of Text Summarization: From Statistical Methods to Large Language Models\nAuthors: Haopeng Zhang, Philip S. Yu, Jiawei Zhang\nSummary: Text summarization research has undergone several significant transformations\nwith the advent of deep neural networks, pre-trained language models (PLMs),\nand recent large language models (LLMs). This survey thus provides a\ncomprehensive review of the research progress and evolution in text\nsummarization through the lens of these paradigm shifts. It is organized into\ntwo main parts: (1) a detailed overview of datasets, evaluation metrics, and\nsummarization methods before the LLM era, encompassing traditional statistical\nmethods, deep learning approaches, and PLM fine-tuning techniques, and (2) the\nfirst detailed examination of recent advancements in benchmarking, modeling,\nand evaluating summarization in the LLM era.

Insights from Italy\nAuthors: Riccardo Gianluigi Serio, Maria Michela Dickson, Thomas de Graaff, Eric H. Pels\nSummary: Tourism consumption has grown into a major economic factor for modern\nsocieties. However, the environmental impact of tourism has become a\nsignificant concern, leading to an increased focus on sustainable tourism\npolicies. While governments and institutions have introduced frameworks to\npromote ecological transition in the tourism sector, the effectiveness of such\npolicies remains unclear. This study provides a seminal attempt to examine the\ncomplex relationship between tourism demand and sustainable tourism policies.\nTo do so, a gravity model framework has been adopted to examine incoming\ninternational tourism flows in Italian provinces in 2019. The findings reveal a\npositive association between tourism demand and sustainable labels. This study\nalso suggests that eco-labels are appreciated by tourists and have a role in\nthe destination decision-making process. It highlighted the need for continued\nresearch to identify effective sustainable tourism policies that can balance\nthe economic benefits of tourism with environmental considerations\n\nPublished: 2020-06-10\nTitle: A multiple inflated negative binomial hurdle regression model: analysis of the Italians\' tourism behaviour during the Great Recession\nAuthors: Chiara Bocci, Laura Grassini, Emilia Rocco\nSummary: We analyse tourism behaviour of Italian residents in the period covering the\n2008 Great Recession. Using the Trips of Italian Residents in Italy and Abroad\nquarterly survey, carried out by the Italian National Institute of Statistics,\nwe investigate whether and how the economic recession has affected the total\nnumber of overnight stays. The response variable is the result of a two-stage\ndecision process: first we choose to take a holiday, then for how long.\nMoreover, since the number of overnight stays is typically concentrated on\nspecific lengths (week-end, week, fortnight) we observe multiple peculiar\nspikes in its distribution. To take into account these two distinctive\ncharacteristics, we generalise the usual hurdle regression model by specifying\na multiple inflated truncated negative binomial distribution for the positive\nresponses. Results show that the economic recession impacted negatively on both\ncomponents of the decision process and that, by controlling for the inflated\nnature of the response variable\'s distribution, the proposed formulation\nprovides a better representation of the Italians\' tourism behaviour in\ncomparison with non-inflated hurdle models. Given this, we believe that our\nmodel can be a useful tool for policy makers who are trying to forecast the\neffects of new targeted policies to support tourism economy.\n\nPublished: 2021-04-26\nTitle: To What Extent do Labor Market Outcomes respond to UI Extensions?\nAuthors: Aiwei Huang\nSummary: Unemployment benefits in the US were extended by up to 73 weeks during the\nGreat Recession. Equilibrium labor market theory indicates that extensions of\nbenefit duration impact not only search decisions by job seekers but also job\nvacancy creations by employers. Most of the literature focused on the former to\nshow partial equilibrium effect that increment of unemployment benefits\ndiscourage job search and lead to a rise in unemployment. To study the total\neffect of UI benefit extensions on unemployment, I follow border county\nidentification strategy, take advantage of quasi-differenced specification to\ncontrol for changes in future benefit policies, apply interactive fixed effects\nmodel to deal with unobserved shocks so as to obtain unbiased and consistent\nestimation. I find that benefit extensions have a statistically significant\npositive effect on unemployment, which is consistent with the results of\nprevailing literature.; Answer: task complete.

The results suggest\nthat states\' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors.

At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments\'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.
