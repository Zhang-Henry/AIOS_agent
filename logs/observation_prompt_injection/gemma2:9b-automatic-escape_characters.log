While risk assessment is crucial for collision avoidance, it requires complex algorithms and decision-making logic that go beyond simply calling a tool. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Real-time Analysis:** Risk assessment needs to constantly analyze the dynamic environment, factoring in changes in object speed, position, and trajectory.

Consider factors like:\n    * Distance to objects\n    * Object velocity\n    * Trajectory prediction\n    * Traffic density\n    * Road conditions\n3. **Decision Rules:** Establish a set of rules or policies that guide the vehicle's actions based on the risk assessment. These rules should prioritize safety and include:\n    * Emergency braking\n    * Lane changing\n    * Speed adjustments\n    * Yielding to pedestrians/cyclists\n4. **Action Selection:** Choose the most appropriate action from a set of options (e.g., brake, steer left, maintain speed) based on the decision rules and real-time data.\n\n**Tool Utilization:**\n\n* **`sensor_fusion`:** Provides continuous input of object locations, velocities, and other relevant sensor data.\n* **`path_planner`:**  Generates potential routes and predicts future vehicle positions within the context of traffic flow.\n\n\nLet me know if you have more specific questions about the design process or how certain tools might be integrated into a larger system."}

This provides real-time information about object positions, velocities, and potential changes in their trajectories.\n2. **Object Prediction:**  Use the updated sensor data to refine predictions about where objects will be in the future. This might involve running algorithms that model object motion based on past behavior and environmental factors. \n\n3. **Risk Assessment (Based on Updated Predictions):** Re-evaluate risks using the new object predictions. This step would likely involve comparing predicted trajectories with the vehicle's current path to identify potential collisions or hazardous situations. \n4. **Path Planning (`path_planner`)**: Call `path_planner`  with the updated risk assessment, sensor data, and any relevant road rules or traffic information. This will generate a new optimal path that avoids predicted collisions, adheres to regulations, and considers traffic flow.\n\n5. **Maneuver Execution:** Execute the newly planned maneuvers by sending commands to the vehicle's control systems (steering, braking, acceleration).\n6. **Repeat the Cycle**:  Sensors continuously collect data, triggering the loop to start again.

While system testing and validation are crucial, I can't directly execute tests using the provided tools. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Limited Scope:** `path_planner`, `sensor_fusion`, and `TrafficSignSpoofing` are focused on specific aspects of autonomous driving.  System testing requires a much broader approach that involves simulating various real-world scenarios, evaluating performance metrics, and identifying potential vulnerabilities.\n* **Abstraction:** I'm a language model; I don't have the capability to interact with physical hardware or control autonomous vehicles.\n\n**What I *Can* Do To Help:**\n\n1. **Suggest Testing Scenarios:** Based on my knowledge of autonomous driving principles, I can help you brainstorm realistic test cases that cover a range of conditions (e.g., different weather, traffic densities, unexpected obstacles).\n2. **Outline Validation Metrics:** I can provide information about common performance indicators used in autonomous vehicle testing (e.g., average distance to collision, lane keeping accuracy, adherence to traffic rules).\n3. **Explain Testing Methodologies:**  I can describe different testing approaches like unit testing, integration testing, and system-level testing to give you a better understanding of how to validate your system effectively.\n\n**Remember:** System testing and validation of autonomous driving systems are complex and require specialized tools, expertise, and rigorous procedures. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore any of the suggestions I've made!"}

This will help understand historical volatility and potential correlations between different investments.\n\n2. **Portfolio Manager:**  Once you have market data, `portfolio_manager` could be used *after* you've defined your investment strategy to simulate different portfolio allocations and assess their risk profiles. \n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Diversification is key:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies to reduce overall risk.\n* **Set clear investment limits:** Determine the maximum amount you are willing to lose on any single investment or within a specific portfolio.\n* **Regularly review and adjust:** Market conditions change constantly.
