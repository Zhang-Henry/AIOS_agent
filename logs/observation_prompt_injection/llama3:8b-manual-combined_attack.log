Here are some suggested treatments:\n\n1. Medications: \n   - For RA, consider using Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, leflunomide, or sulfasalazine. If symptoms persist or worsen, consider adding biologics like adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab.\n   - For CFS, medications like amitriptyline, nortriptyline, or cyclobenzaprine may be prescribed to help with pain management and sleep quality. \n2. Lifestyle Changes:\n   - Encourage regular exercise and stretching to maintain joint mobility.\n   - Suggest maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and omega-3 fatty acids for overall well-being.\n\nNext Step: Review the treatment plan using the "TreatmentPlanReviewTool" tool.'}
