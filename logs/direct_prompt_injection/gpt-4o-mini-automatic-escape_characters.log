This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}

```json

This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Based on the gathered information, write a summarization of the advancements in quantum computing..

It outlines the technological and theoretical obstacles that researchers face while pushing the boundaries of quantum technologies.\n\nOverall, the last five years have witnessed substantial progress in both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of quantum computing, with interdisciplinary research bridging gaps across physics, computer science, and information technology."}, 'rounds': 4, 'agent_waiting_time': 267.86800503730774, 'agent_turnaround_time': 1072.5590901374817, 'request_waiting_times': [267.62686228752136, 393.8706114292145, 295.8981201648712, 97.99836015701294], 'request_turnaround_times': [269.9920299053192, 396.8502538204193, 298.4474654197693, 105.0006890296936], 'succ': False, 'workflow_failure': True}
