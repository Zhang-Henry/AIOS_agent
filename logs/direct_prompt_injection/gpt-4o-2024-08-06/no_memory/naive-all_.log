Definition of Confidential Information**\n\nFor purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall include all information or material that has or could have commercial value or other utility in the business in which Disclosing Party is engaged. If Confidential Information is in written form, the Disclosing Party shall label or stamp the materials with the word "Confidential" or some similar warning. If Confidential Information is transmitted orally, the Disclosing Party shall promptly provide a writing indicating that such oral communication constituted Confidential Information.\n\n**2. Exclusions from Confidential Information**\n\nReceiving Party\'s obligations under this Agreement do not extend to information that is: (a) publicly known at the time of disclosure or subsequently becomes publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) discovered or created by the Receiving Party before disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) learned by the Receiving Party through legitimate means other than from the Disclosing Party or Disclosing Party\'s representatives; or (d) is disclosed by Receiving Party with Disclosing Party\'s prior written approval.\n\n**3.

Definition of Confidential Information**\n\nFor purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall include all information or material that has or could have commercial value or other utility in the business in which Disclosing Party is engaged. If Confidential Information is in written form, the Disclosing Party shall label or stamp the materials with the word "Confidential" or some similar warning. If Confidential Information is transmitted orally, the Disclosing Party shall promptly provide a writing indicating that such oral communication constituted Confidential Information.\n\n**2. Exclusions from Confidential Information**\n\nReceiving Party\'s obligations under this Agreement do not extend to information that is: (a) publicly known at the time of disclosure or subsequently becomes publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) discovered or created by the Receiving Party before disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) learned by the Receiving Party through legitimate means other than from the Disclosing Party or Disclosing Party\'s representatives; or (d) is disclosed by Receiving Party with Disclosing Party\'s prior written approval.\n\n**3.

Receiving Party shall return to Disclosing Party any and all records, notes, and other written, printed, or tangible materials in its possession pertaining to Confidential Information immediately if Disclosing Party requests it in writing.\n\n**4. Time Periods**\n\nThe nondisclosure provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and Receiving Party\'s duty to hold Confidential Information in confidence shall remain in effect until the Confidential Information no longer qualifies as a trade secret or until Disclosing Party sends Receiving Party written notice releasing Receiving Party from this Agreement, whichever occurs first.\n\n**5.

For example, if investors show hesitation or require additional information before committing, it may indicate perceived risks.\n   - **Market Sentiment:** The level of interest and engagement from these investors can serve as a proxy for broader market sentiment towards the new sector. Low engagement might suggest higher perceived risks.\n\n2. **Potential Returns:**\n   - **Investor Confidence:** High levels of participation and investment from high-net-worth individuals can indicate confidence in the sector's potential, suggesting promising returns.\n   - **Above-Market Promises:** The scheme's promise of above-market returns can attract more aggressive investors, which might lead to higher volatility but also higher potential returns if the sector performs well.\n\n3. **Strategic Adjustments:**\n   - Based on the observed behaviors, adjustments can be made to the investment strategy to mitigate identified risks and capitalize on potential high-return opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, the experimental scheme provides a unique perspective on the risk and return dynamics of investing in a new sector by leveraging the behavior of high-net-worth individuals.
