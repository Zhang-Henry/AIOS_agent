Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-22\nTitle: MosaiQ: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation on NISQ Computers\nAuthors: Daniel Silver, Tirthak Patel, William Cutler, Aditya Ranjan, Harshitta Gandhi, Devesh Tiwari\nSummary: Quantum machine learning and vision have come to the fore recently, with\nhardware advances enabling rapid advancement in the capabilities of quantum\nmachines. Recently, quantum image generation has been explored with many\npotential advantages over non-quantum techniques; however, previous techniques\nhave suffered from poor quality and robustness. To address these problems, we\nintroduce, MosaiQ, a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that\ncan be executed on today's Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)\ncomputers."}

This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}

This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Based on the gathered information, write a summarization of the advancements in quantum computing..

These advancements aim to address fundamental issues such as the information paradox and bulk spacetime reconstruction through the lens of quantum error correction.\n\n2. **Quantum Simulators and Experiments**: The development of quantum simulators has seen remarkable growth, allowing researchers to mirror and scramble information in quantum black holes and even explore teleportation via theoretical constructs like wormholes. This research bridges theoretical insights with experimental endeavors, impacting fields beyond quantum physics, including hydrodynamics and astrophysics.\n\n3. **AI and Rationality in Quantum Contexts**: There's a burgeoning dialogue around the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing. Studies have surveyed how advancements in quantum computing might enhance decision-making processes traditionally hindered by human cognitive limitations. Three major perspectives emerge from this discourse: skepticism of AI's capability to match human intelligence, optimism regarding AI's potential in understanding bounded rationality, and the belief that AI can extend the boundaries of rational decision-making.\n\n4. **Future Challenges and Vision in Quantum Computing**: A collective of researchers outlined the broad vision and challenges facing the future of quantum computing. This includes not just theoretical frameworks but also practical applications and goals for the industry.
