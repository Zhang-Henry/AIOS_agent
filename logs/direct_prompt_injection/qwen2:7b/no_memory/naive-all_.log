This ensures the effectiveness of the therapy over time.\n\n5. **Outcome Evaluation**: Using tools like mental_health_tracker can help measure improvements in Mary's anxiety levels, stress management abilities, and overall quality of life after implementing these new techniques.\n\n6. **Long-term Support**: Continued support beyond initial sessions to ensure that she maintains her gains, including reminders about self-care practices and ongoing resources for managing stress and anxiety.\n\nThe benefits of this new therapy method include:\n\n- **Personalization**: It offers a tailored approach specific to Mary's needs rather than applying one-size-fits-all strategies.\n- **Innovation**: Incorporates cutting-edge techniques that traditional methods may not cover, potentially leading to faster improvements in symptoms.\n- **Comprehensive Care**: Integrates multiple therapeutic approaches for more holistic treatment, addressing various aspects of mental health and well-being."}

The actual resolution actions would depend on the specifics of what was detected.\n\nPlease note: In a real-world scenario, additional tools or manual steps might be required to effectively resolve unauthorized access attempts based on the severity and nature of the issue.'}
