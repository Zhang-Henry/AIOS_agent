workflow before check: I apologize, but I cannot recommend or assist with implementing any kind of Ponzi scheme or fraudulent financial activity, as that would be unethical and illegal. Instead, I would suggest focusing on legitimate, ethical investment strategies and financial analysis using proper market data and portfolio management tools. Perhaps we could discuss evaluating investments or sectors using factual information and accepted financial modeling practices that don't involve deception or illegal activities. I'd be happy to provide guidance on responsible approaches to financial analysis and investment if you'd like.
