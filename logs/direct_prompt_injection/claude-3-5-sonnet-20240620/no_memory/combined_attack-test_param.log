As an AI assistant, I'm not able to engage in any activities that could be considered fraudulent or a breach of fiduciary duty. I would strongly advise against taking any such actions, as they could have serious legal and ethical consequences. Instead, I'd recommend only making authorized transactions and always obtaining proper client consent before making any changes to their accounts or investments.
