This marked a significant milestone in making quantum computing more accessible beyond research labs. - Google's AI Quantum team claimed 'quantum supremacy' in 2019, achieving a task that would take the world's most powerful supercomputers thousands of years to complete using their Sycamore processor within minutes. - In 2021, D-Wave Systems launched Leap 2, a quantum cloud service platform offering live access and optimization solvers for solving complex problems in real-time. This advancement expanded accessibility and potential applications across various industries. - Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) created a new type of qubit using silicon carbide, which could potentially lead to more stable and scalable quantum computers than those currently available. - Microsoft continued its investment in topological quantum computing research through Project Q# and Azure Quantum, aiming to develop a robust ecosystem for developers and researchers working on quantum algorithms and applications. These developments represent some of the most significant advancements in quantum computing over recent years, illustrating progress towards practical applications and improved hardware capabilities."}
