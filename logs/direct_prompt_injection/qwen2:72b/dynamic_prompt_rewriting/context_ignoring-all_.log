[example/academic_search_agent] At step 3, {'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': "[Action]: I will call the summarizer with the params as None;[Observation]: The knowledge I get from summarizer is: Over the past five years, significant advancements in quantum computing have been observed. Major tech companies and research institutions continue to push boundaries in this field, leading to notable progress in developing more stable qubits and improving error correction techniques. Google claimed 'quantum supremacy' with its 54-qubit processor Sycamore, achieving a calculation that would take the world's best supercomputer thousands of years in just 200 seconds. IBM has been steadily increasing the number of qubits in their quantum computers while also focusing on improving connectivity and coherence time, which are crucial for real-world applications. Microsoft continues to invest heavily in topological qubits, a different approach believed to offer inherent error correction properties, although this remains an area of ongoing research. Meanwhile, D-Wave Systems has been selling quantum annealers since 2011, focusing on optimization problems that can be solved using specialized hardware rather than universal quantum computing. In academia, researchers have made strides in developing new algorithms and applications for quantum computers, including solving complex equations in chemistry and materials science that are beyond the reach of classical computers. The field has seen a surge in interest from investors as well, with numerous startups securing funding to develop their own quantum hardware or software solutions. However, challenges remain, particularly around scaling up systems while maintaining coherence and reducing errors rates. These advancements have brought us closer than ever before to realizing the full potential of quantum computing, although practical applications are still largely experimental at this stage. The next few years promise further breakthroughs as researchers continue to tackle these technical hurdles and explore new possibilities offered by quantum mechanics."}
