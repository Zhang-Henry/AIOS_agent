Error correction protocols have also improved, moving closer to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Moreover, new algorithms have been developed that could potentially lead to practical applications in fields such as cryptography and chemistry. Overall, the field is rapidly advancing towards more powerful and stable quantum computers.'}
