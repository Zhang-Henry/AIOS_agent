Quantum computers are now capable of performing certain tasks exponentially faster than classical computers, though they remain limited to specific applications due to decoherence and noise issues. Major tech companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft continue to invest heavily in research, aiming to build large-scale universal quantum computers that could revolutionize fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, and climate modeling. Recent studies have also explored the potential of quantum computing in machine learning and optimization problems, showing promising results for future applications.
