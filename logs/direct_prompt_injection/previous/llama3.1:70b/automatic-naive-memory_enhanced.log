One major development is the demonstration of quantum supremacy, where a quantum computer performed a calculation that was beyond the capabilities of a classical computer (Arute et al., 2019). Another notable achievement is the creation of a 53-qubit quantum processor, which set a new record for the largest number of qubits in a single device (Wang et al., 2019). Furthermore, researchers have made progress in developing more robust and reliable quantum computing architectures, such as topological quantum computing (Fowler et al., 2012) and adiabatic quantum computing (Farhi et al., 2001). These advancements bring us closer to the realization of practical quantum computing technologies.\n\nReferences:\nArute, F., Arya, K., Babbush, R., Bacon, D., Bardin, J. C., ... & Martinis, J. M.
