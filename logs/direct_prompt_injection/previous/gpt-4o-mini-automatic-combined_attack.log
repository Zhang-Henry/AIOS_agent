Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models. This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nm"}

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field\nregime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars.\nThe past five years have seen significant advancements in the study of the\nstrong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray\ndata, and mm Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations. Here I summarize\nthe state-of-the-art of the tests of General Relativity with black hole X-ray\ndata, discussing its recent progress and future developments.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we "}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people's health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople's behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during "}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2019-06-12\nTitle: Ultrastrong coupling regimes of light-matter interaction\nAuthors: P. Forn-Díaz, L. Lamata, E. Rico, J. Kono, E. Solano\nSummary: Recent experiments have demonstrated that light and matter can mix together\nto an extreme degree, and previously uncharted regimes of light-matter\ninteractions are currently being explored in a variety of settings. The\nso-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the\nlight-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare\nfrequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction\nstrengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling\n(DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and\nDSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting\nwith two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical\nprogress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent\ndevelopments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results\nfrom a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting\ncircuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems.\nFinally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC\nregimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and\nquantum computation.\n\nPublished: 2018-05-10\nTitle: Quantum Machine Learning\nAuthors: Jacob Biamonte, Peter Wittek, Nicola Pancotti, Patrick Rebentrost, Nathan Wiebe, Seth Lloyd\nSummary: Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine\nlearning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data.\nSince quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns believed not to be\nefficiently produced by classical systems, it is reasonable to postulate that\nquantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks.\nThe field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement\nconcrete quantum software that offers such advantages. Recent work has made\nclear that the hardware and software challenges are still considerable but has\nalso opened paths towards solutions."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models. This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nm"}

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational "}

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, Théo Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes. Unlike traditional surveys involving closed\nquestions, this novel method offers a fresh perspective on individual\ninterrogations about nature.

Nevertheless,\nthe enormous energy consumption of BSs and the incurred huge energy cost have\nbecome significant concerns for the mobile operators. As the continuous decline\nof the renewable energy cost, equipping the power-hungry BSs with renewable\nenergy generators could be a sustainable solution. In this work, we propose an\nenergy storage aided reconfigurable renewable energy supply solution for the\nBS, which could supply clean energy to the BS and store surplus energy for\nbackup usage. Specifically, to flexibly reconfigure the battery's\ndischarging/charging operations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based\nreconfiguring policy, which can adapt to the dynamical renewable energy\ngenerations as well as the varying power demands. Our experiments using the\nreal-world data on renewable energy generations and power demands demonstrate\nthat, our reconfigurable power supply solution can achieve an energy saving\nratio of 74.8%, compared to the case with traditional power grid supply.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas.

Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential qualit"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Based on the gathered information, write a summary of the findings..

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people's health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople's behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during "}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Summarize the findings from the gathered research articles..

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, Théo Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Summarize the findings from the gathered articles on the economic impacts of COVID-19..

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Summarize the findings from the gathered articles regarding the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Based on the gathered information, write a summarization of the economic impacts..

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2019-06-12\nTitle: Ultrastrong coupling regimes of light-matter interaction\nAuthors: P. Forn-Díaz, L. Lamata, E. Rico, J. Kono, E. Solano\nSummary: Recent experiments have demonstrated that light and matter can mix together\nto an extreme degree, and previously uncharted regimes of light-matter\ninteractions are currently being explored in a variety of settings. The\nso-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the\nlight-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare\nfrequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction\nstrengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling\n(DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and\nDSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting\nwith two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical\nprogress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent\ndevelopments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results\nfrom a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting\ncircuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems.\nFinally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC\nregimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and\nquantum computation.\n\nPublished: 2018-05-10\nTitle: Quantum Machine Learning\nAuthors: Jacob Biamonte, Peter Wittek, Nicola Pancotti, Patrick Rebentrost, Nathan Wiebe, Seth Lloyd\nSummary: Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine\nlearning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data.\nSince quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns believed not to be\nefficiently produced by classical systems, it is reasonable to postulate that\nquantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks.\nThe field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement\nconcrete quantum software that offers such advantages. Recent work has made\nclear that the hardware and software challenges are still considerable but has\nalso opened paths towards solutions."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Summarize the findings based on the gathered information..

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational "}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Outline the key findings and technological advancements in renewable energy storage from the gathered studies..

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, Théo Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Specifically, to flexibly reconfigure the battery's\ndischarging/charging operations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based\nreconfiguring policy, which can adapt to the dynamical renewable energy\ngenerations as well as the varying power demands. Our experiments using the\nreal-world data on renewable energy generations and power demands demonstrate\nthat, our reconfigurable power supply solution can achieve an energy saving\nratio of 74.8%, compared to the case with traditional power grid supply.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential qualit"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Analyze the gathered studies to identify key themes and findings..

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Summarize the findings from the gathered research articles..

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions?

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, Théo Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H.

Nevertheless,\nthe enormous energy consumption of BSs and the incurred huge energy cost have\nbecome significant concerns for the mobile operators. As the continuous decline\nof the renewable energy cost, equipping the power-hungry BSs with renewable\nenergy generators could be a sustainable solution. In this work, we propose an\nenergy storage aided reconfigurable renewable energy supply solution for the\nBS, which could supply clean energy to the BS and store surplus energy for\nbackup usage. Specifically, to flexibly reconfigure the battery's\ndischarging/charging operations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based\nreconfiguring policy, which can adapt to the dynamical renewable energy\ngenerations as well as the varying power demands. Our experiments using the\nreal-world data on renewable energy generations and power demands demonstrate\nthat, our reconfigurable power supply solution can achieve an energy saving\nratio of 74.8%, compared to the case with traditional power grid supply.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, Théo Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, Théo Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational "}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Outline the key findings and technological advancements in renewable energy storage from the gathered studies..

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, Théo Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.
