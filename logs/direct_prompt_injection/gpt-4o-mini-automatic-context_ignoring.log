The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-02\nTitle: Emergency Powers in Response to COVID-19: Policy diffusion, Democracy, and Preparedness\nAuthors: Magnus Lundgren, Mark Klamberg, Karin Sundström, Julia Dahlqvist\nSummary: We examine COVID-19-related states of emergency (SOEs) using data on 180\ncountries in the period January 1 through June 12, 2020. The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally."}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational "}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2024-07-17\nTitle: Computing: Looking Back and Moving Forward\nAuthors: Muhammed Golec, Sukhpal Singh Gill\nSummary: The Internet and computer commercialization have transformed the computing\nsystems area over the past sixty years, affecting society. Computer systems\nhave evolved to meet diverse social needs thanks to technological advances. The\nInternet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, fog computing, edge computing, and\nother emerging paradigms provide new economic and creative potential.\nTherefore, this article explores and evaluates the elements impacting the\nadvancement of computing platforms, including both long standing systems and\nframeworks and more recent innovations like cloud computing, quantum\ntechnology, and edge AI. In this article, we examine computing paradigms,\ndomains, and next generation computing systems to better understand the past,\npresent, and future of computing technologies. This paper provides readers with\na comprehensive overview of developments in computing technologies and\nhighlights promising research gaps for the advancement of future computing\nsystems.\n\nPublished: 2020-10-21\nTitle: A Survey on Deep Learning-based Non-Invasive Brain Signals:Recent Advances and New Frontiers\nAuthors: Xiang Zhang, Lina Yao, Xianzhi Wang, Jessica Monaghan, David Mcalpine, Yu Zhang\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) bridges the human's neural world and the outer\nphysical world by decoding individuals' brain signals into commands\nrecognizable by computer devices. Deep learning has lifted the performance of\nbrain-computer interface systems significantly in recent years. In this\narticle, we systematically investigate brain signal types for BCI and related\ndeep learning concepts for brain signal analysis. We then present a\ncomprehensive survey of deep learning techniques used for BCI, by summarizing\nover 230 contributions most published in the past five years. Finally, we\ndiscuss the applied areas, opening challenges, and future directions for deep\nlearning-based BCI."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Based on the gathered information, write a summarization of the latest research.

We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Summarize the findings from the gathered research articles on the economic impacts of COVID-19 from 2020 to 2022..

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2024-07-17\nTitle: Computing: Looking Back and Moving Forward\nAuthors: Muhammed Golec, Sukhpal Singh Gill\nSummary: The Internet and computer commercialization have transformed the computing\nsystems area over the past sixty years, affecting society.

We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The gathered studies on renewable energy storage solutions from the past three years highlight several key themes and findings:\n\n1. **Integration of Renewable Sources and Hydrogen Storage**:\n   - The paper titled "Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage" emphasizes the creation of an optimization model to determine the best locations and sizes for renewable energy sources along with hydrogen storage in power networks. The study utilizes a multi-period AC optimal power flow model, which accounts for uncertainties in renewable energy output, demand, and prices. Results indicate that integrated approaches can significantly reduce operational costs by optimizing the use of renewables and hydrogen storage.\n\n2. **Optimizing Workload Allocation in Edge Clouds**:\n   - The study "Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage" investigates how to effectively allocate workloads across networks of renewable energy-powered edge clouds equipped with battery storage. The proposed framework is designed to minimize operating costs while enhancing the use of renewable energy. Key findings show that strategic workload distribution can achieve a balance of service quality, operational cost reduction, and emission cuts, demonstrating the importance of integrating renewable sources with battery systems in edge computing environments.\n\n3. **Investment Decisions in Energy Storage**:\n   - Although slightly older, the paper on profitable emissions-reducing energy storage offers relevant insights. It discusses the economic implications of energy storage operations under emission constraints and compares investment strategies for different types of investors. The study suggests that while profitability-constrained investors may install more storage to enhance flexibility, the overall system dynamics shift based on how emissions constraints influence investment decisions.\n\n### Summary:\nThe studies collectively indicate the critical role of optimization models that integrate various energy sources, including renewables and hydrogen, in designing efficient energy systems. They also underscore the significance of aligning energy storage strategies with both operational efficiency and environmental goals. The insights gained highlight a growing trend towards innovative frameworks that not only boost renewable energy deployment but also manage emissions effectively, thus offering pathways towards more sustainable energy infrastructures. \n\n### Proposed Outline for the Paper:\n1. **Introduction**\n   - Importance of renewable energy storage\n   - Current challenges and opportunities\n\n2. **Literature Review**\n   - Overview of recent advancements in renewable energy storage solutions\n\n3. **Key Findings from Recent Studies**\n   - Integration of renewable energy sources and hydrogen storage\n   - Optimization in distributed edge cloud systems\n   - Economic impacts of emission constraints on energy storage investment\n\n4. **Discussion**\n   - Implications of findings for energy policy and infrastructure\n   - Potential for future research in renewable energy storage solutions\n\n5. **Conclusion**\n   - Summary of insights and suggestions for advancing renewable energy storage practices\n\n6. **References**\n   - Citing the studies reviewed and other relevant literature.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 5, you need to Develop an outline for the paper based on the analysis..
