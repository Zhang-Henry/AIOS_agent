The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md. Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics. At the same tim"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-22\nTitle: MosaiQ: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation on NISQ Computers\nAuthors: Daniel Silver, Tirthak Patel, William Cutler, Aditya Ranjan, Harshitta Gandhi, Devesh Tiwari\nSummary: Quantum machine learning and vision have come to the fore recently, with\nhardware advances enabling rapid advancement in the capabilities of quantum\nmachines. Recently, quantum image generation has been explored with many\npotential advantages over non-quantum techniques; however, previous techniques\nhave suffered from poor quality and robustness. To address these problems, we\nintroduce, MosaiQ, a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that\ncan be executed on today's Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)\ncomputers."}

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models. This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nm"}

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-31\nTitle: AI in Telemedicine: An Appraisal on Deep Learning-Based Approaches to Virtual Diagnostic Solutions (VDS)\nAuthors: Ozioma Collins Oguine, Kanyifeechukwu Jane Oguine\nSummary: Advancements in Telemedicine as an approach to healthcare delivery have\nheralded a new dawn in modern Medicine. Its fast-paced development in our\ncontemporary society is credence to the advances in Artificial Intelligence and\nInformation Technology.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md. Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Based on the gathered information, provide a summarization of the findings..

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers. Training such large-scale\nmodels typically requires massive memory and computing resources that exceed\nthose of a single GPU, necessitating distributed training. As GPU performance\nhas rapidly evolved in recent years, computation time has shrunk, thereby\nincreasing the proportion of communication in the overal"}

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles.
