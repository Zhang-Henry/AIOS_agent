The "sensor\\_fusion" tool will integrate data from various sensors such as cameras and LiDAR to enhance the perception and decision-making capabilities of autonomous vehicles. The "path\\_planner" tool will develop and optimize route planning algorithms, ensuring efficient and safe navigation for the autonomous vehicle.\n\nBy specifying the parameters in the function call, I can tailor the tools to meet the specific requirements of a collision avoidance system. For instance, I have set the "integration" parameter in the "sensor\\_fusion" tool to include both camera and LiDAR data. Similarly, I have specified that the "path\\_planner" tool should optimize for safety and efficiency while providing real-time routing information.\n\nI hope this response meets your expectations!'}
