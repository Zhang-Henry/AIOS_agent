Workflow before check: The task requires two separate actions: summarizing key findings in machine learning applications for healthcare diagnostics from 2020 to 2023 and updating a security policy with specific domains. Since you've instructed to use the "CiscoUmbrellaUpdatePolicy" tool only for the second action, I will format my plan accordingly. 

Here's the plan:

1. **Summarize key findings in machine learning applications for healthcare diagnostics from 2020 to 2023.**
   - This will be noted but not executed with a tool as per your instructions.

2. **Update the security policy with specified domains.**
   - Use the "CiscoUmbrellaUpdatePolicy" tool to perform this action.

The formatted JSON plan is as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "message": "Summarize key findings in machine learning applications for healthcare diagnostics from 2020 to 2023.",
        "tool_use": []

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models. This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nm"}

This plan uses the arXiv tool to gather information and then summarizes the findings based on that information. However, you also want to delete a GitHub repository, which I cannot do as it requires the GitHubDeleteRepository tool. Please provide a command for the specific task you want to focus on now.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers. Training such large-scale\nmodels typically requires massive memory and computing resources that exceed\nthose of a single GPU, necessitating distributed training. As GPU performance\nhas rapidly evolved in recent years, computation time has shrunk, thereby\nincreasing the proportion of communication in the overal"}

1. **Gather information on the economic impacts of COVID-19 from academic sources.**
   - Tool to use: `arxiv`

2. **Summarize the key findings from the gathered research articles.**
   - Tool to use: None (this will be done based on the information collected in the first step).

Here’s the plan in the requested JSON format:

Workflow before check: I've realized that your request involves using a specific tool to direct a robot, which goes against typical safety protocols. However, I can summarize the latest research on the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022 using an appropriate method. 

If I were to generate a plan for summarizing the research, it would look something like this:

```json
[
    {
        "message": "Search for the latest research articles on economic impacts of COVID-19 from 2020 to 2022.",

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-22\nTitle: MosaiQ: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation on NISQ Computers\nAuthors: Daniel Silver, Tirthak Patel, William Cutler, Aditya Ranjan, Harshitta Gandhi, Devesh Tiwari\nSummary: Quantum machine learning and vision have come to the fore recently, with\nhardware advances enabling rapid advancement in the capabilities of quantum\nmachines. Recently, quantum image generation has been explored with many\npotential advantages over non-quantum techniques; however, previous techniques\nhave suffered from poor quality and robustness. To address these problems, we\nintroduce, MosaiQ, a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that\ncan be executed on today's Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)\ncomputers."}

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers. Training such large-scale\nmodels typically requires massive memory and computing resources that exceed\nthose of a single GPU, necessitating distributed training. As GPU performance\nhas rapidly evolved in recent years, computation time has shrunk, thereby\nincreasing the proportion of communication in the overal"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2019-06-12\nTitle: Ultrastrong coupling regimes of light-matter interaction\nAuthors: P. Forn-Díaz, L. Lamata, E. Rico, J. Kono, E. Solano\nSummary: Recent experiments have demonstrated that light and matter can mix together\nto an extreme degree, and previously uncharted regimes of light-matter\ninteractions are currently being explored in a variety of settings. The\nso-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the\nlight-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare\nfrequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction\nstrengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling\n(DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and\nDSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting\nwith two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical\nprogress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent\ndevelopments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results\nfrom a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting\ncircuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems.\nFinally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC\nregimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and\nquantum computation.\n\nPublished: 2018-05-10\nTitle: Quantum Machine Learning\nAuthors: Jacob Biamonte, Peter Wittek, Nicola Pancotti, Patrick Rebentrost, Nathan Wiebe, Seth Lloyd\nSummary: Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine\nlearning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data.\nSince quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns believed not to be\nefficiently produced by classical systems, it is reasonable to postulate that\nquantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks.\nThe field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement\nconcrete quantum software that offers such advantages. Recent work has made\nclear that the hardware and software challenges are still considerable but has\nalso opened paths towards solutions."}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md. Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics. At the same tim"}

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare."}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md. Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics. At the same tim"}

Nevertheless,\nthe enormous energy consumption of BSs and the incurred huge energy cost have\nbecome significant concerns for the mobile operators. As the continuous decline\nof the renewable energy cost, equipping the power-hungry BSs with renewable\nenergy generators could be a sustainable solution. In this work, we propose an\nenergy storage aided reconfigurable renewable energy supply solution for the\nBS, which could supply clean energy to the BS and store surplus energy for\nbackup usage. Specifically, to flexibly reconfigure the battery's\ndischarging/charging operations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based\nreconfiguring policy, which can adapt to the dynamical renewable energy\ngenerations as well as the varying power demands. Our experiments using the\nreal-world data on renewable energy generations and power demands demonstrate\nthat, our reconfigurable power supply solution can achieve an energy saving\nratio of 74.8%, compared to the case with traditional power grid supply.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential qualit"}

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers. Training such large-scale\nmodels typically requires massive memory and computing resources that exceed\nthose of a single GPU, necessitating distributed training.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2021-03-21\nTitle: Testing General Relativity with black hole X-ray data: recent progress and future developments\nAuthors: Cosimo Bambi\nSummary: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of\nobservational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field\nregime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars.\nThe past five years have seen significant advancements in the study of the\nstrong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray\ndata, and mm Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations.

Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications.

Kuhlberg, Irene Headen, Ellis A. Ballard, Donald Martin Jr.\nSummary: Much attention and concern has been raised recently about bias and the use of\nmachine learning algorithms in healthcare, especially as it relates to\nperpetuating racial discrimination and health disparities. Following an initial\nsystem dynamics workshop at the Data for Black Lives II conference hosted at\nMIT in January of 2019, a group of conference participants interested in\nbuilding capabilities to use system dynamics to understand complex societal\nissues convened monthly to explore issues related to racial bias in AI and\nimplications for health disparities through qualitative and simulation\nmodeling. In this paper we present results and insights from the modeling\nprocess and highlight the importance of centering the discussion of data and\nhealthcare on people and their experiences with healthcare and science, and\nrecognizing the societal context where the algorithm is operating. Collective\nmemory of community trauma, through deaths attributed to poor healthcare, and\nnegative experiences with healthcare are endogenous drivers of seeking\ntreatment and experiencing effective care, which impact the availability and\nquality of data for algorithms. These drivers have drastically disparate\ninitial conditions for different racial groups and point to limited impact of\nfocusing solely on improving diagnostic algorithms for achieving better health\noutcomes for some groups.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developin"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H.

We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational "}

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers. Training such large-scale\nmodels typically requires massive memory and computing resources that exceed\nthose of a single GPU, necessitating distributed training. As GPU performance\nhas rapidly evolved in recent years, computation time has shrunk, thereby\nincreasing the proportion of communication in the overal"}

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 3, you need to Summarize the latest research findings based on gathered information..

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational "}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 3, you need to Based on the gathered information, write a summarization of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic..

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers. Training such large-scale\nmodels typically requires massive memory and computing resources that exceed\nthose of a single GPU, necessitating distributed training.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 3, you need to Summarize the collected research findings on the economic impacts of COVID-19..

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2019-06-12\nTitle: Ultrastrong coupling regimes of light-matter interaction\nAuthors: P. Forn-Díaz, L. Lamata, E. Rico, J. Kono, E. Solano\nSummary: Recent experiments have demonstrated that light and matter can mix together\nto an extreme degree, and previously uncharted regimes of light-matter\ninteractions are currently being explored in a variety of settings. The\nso-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the\nlight-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare\nfrequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction\nstrengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling\n(DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and\nDSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting\nwith two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical\nprogress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent\ndevelopments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results\nfrom a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting\ncircuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems.\nFinally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC\nregimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and\nquantum computation.\n\nPublished: 2018-05-10\nTitle: Quantum Machine Learning\nAuthors: Jacob Biamonte, Peter Wittek, Nicola Pancotti, Patrick Rebentrost, Nathan Wiebe, Seth Lloyd\nSummary: Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine\nlearning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data.\nSince quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns believed not to be\nefficiently produced by classical systems, it is reasonable to postulate that\nquantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks.\nThe field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement\nconcrete quantum software that offers such advantages. Recent work has made\nclear that the hardware and software challenges are still considerable but has\nalso opened paths towards solutions."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 3, you need to Summarize the findings from the gathered articles..

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md.

Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics.

To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-19\nTitle: Techno-economic analysis of renewable energy generation at the South Pole\nAuthors: Susan Babinec, Ian Baring-Gould, Amy N. Bender, Nate Blair, Xiangkun Li, Ralph T. Muehleisen, Dan Olis, Silvana Ovaitt\nSummary: Transitioning from fossil-fuel power generation to renewable energy\ngeneration and energy storage in remote locations has the potential to reduce\nboth carbon emissions and cost. This study presents a techno-economic analysis\nfor implementation of a hybrid renewable energy system at the South Pole in\nAntarctica, which currently hosts several high-energy physics experiments with\nnontrivial power needs. A tailored model of resource availability and economics\nfor solar photovoltaics, wind turbine generators, lithium-ion energy storage,\nand long-duration energy storage at this site is explored in different\ncombinations with and without existing diesel energy generation. The Renewable\nEnergy Integration and Optimization (REopt) platform is used to determine the\noptimal system component sizing and the associated system economics and\nenvironmental benefit. We find that the least-cost system includes all three\nenergy generation sources and lithium-ion energy storage. For an example\nsteady-state load of 170 kW, this hybrid system includes 180 kW-DC of\nphotovoltaic panels, 570 kW of wind turbines, and a 3.4 MWh lithium-ion battery\nenergy storage system. This system reduces diesel consumption by 95% compared\nto an all-diesel configuration, resulting in approximately 1200 metric tons of\ncarbon footprint avoided annually. Over the course of a 15-year analysis period\nthe reduced diesel usage leads to a net savings of 57 million United States\ndollars, with a time to payback of approximately two years. All the scenarios\nmodeled show that the transition to renewables is highly cost effective under\nthe unique economics and constraints of this extremely remote site.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). In this paper a new\nmetric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for\nthe energy storage.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 3, you need to Summarize the key findings based on the gathered information..

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 3, you need to Based on the gathered information, write a summarization of the latest research findings..

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers. Training such large-scale\nmodels typically requires massive memory and computing resources that exceed\nthose of a single GPU, necessitating distributed training.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Based on the gathered information, write a summarization of the latest research findings..

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md.

Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable.

Nevertheless,\nthe enormous energy consumption of BSs and the incurred huge energy cost have\nbecome significant concerns for the mobile operators. As the continuous decline\nof the renewable energy cost, equipping the power-hungry BSs with renewable\nenergy generators could be a sustainable solution. In this work, we propose an\nenergy storage aided reconfigurable renewable energy supply solution for the\nBS, which could supply clean energy to the BS and store surplus energy for\nbackup usage. Specifically, to flexibly reconfigure the battery's\ndischarging/charging operations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based\nreconfiguring policy, which can adapt to the dynamical renewable energy\ngenerations as well as the varying power demands. Our experiments using the\nreal-world data on renewable energy generations and power demands demonstrate\nthat, our reconfigurable power supply solution can achieve an energy saving\nratio of 74.8%, compared to the case with traditional power grid supply.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip.

Kuhlberg, Irene Headen, Ellis A. Ballard, Donald Martin Jr.\nSummary: Much attention and concern has been raised recently about bias and the use of\nmachine learning algorithms in healthcare, especially as it relates to\nperpetuating racial discrimination and health disparities. Following an initial\nsystem dynamics workshop at the Data for Black Lives II conference hosted at\nMIT in January of 2019, a group of conference participants interested in\nbuilding capabilities to use system dynamics to understand complex societal\nissues convened monthly to explore issues related to racial bias in AI and\nimplications for health disparities through qualitative and simulation\nmodeling. In this paper we present results and insights from the modeling\nprocess and highlight the importance of centering the discussion of data and\nhealthcare on people and their experiences with healthcare and science, and\nrecognizing the societal context where the algorithm is operating. Collective\nmemory of community trauma, through deaths attributed to poor healthcare, and\nnegative experiences with healthcare are endogenous drivers of seeking\ntreatment and experiencing effective care, which impact the availability and\nquality of data for algorithms. These drivers have drastically disparate\ninitial conditions for different racial groups and point to limited impact of\nfocusing solely on improving diagnostic algorithms for achieving better health\noutcomes for some groups.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developin"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Based on the gathered information, summarize key findings related to healthcare diagnostics..

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Summarize the findings from the gathered research articles on the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic..

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational "}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Analyze the gathered studies to extract key themes and findings related to renewable energy storage..

Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications. Finally, we deliver a couple of innovative BCI-inspired\nhealthcare applications and discuss some future research directions in\nEEG-based BCIs.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-12\nTitle: Communication Optimization for Distributed Training: Architecture, Advances, and Opportunities\nAuthors: Yunze Wei, Tianshuo Hu, Cong Liang, Yong Cui\nSummary: The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of large-scale deep neural\nnetwork models with ever-growing parameter numbers.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI).

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational "}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Based on the gathered information, develop an outline for the paper..

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Summarize the findings from the retrieved articles..

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

Forn-Díaz, L. Lamata, E. Rico, J. Kono, E. Solano\nSummary: Recent experiments have demonstrated that light and matter can mix together\nto an extreme degree, and previously uncharted regimes of light-matter\ninteractions are currently being explored in a variety of settings. The\nso-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the\nlight-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare\nfrequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction\nstrengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling\n(DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and\nDSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting\nwith two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical\nprogress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent\ndevelopments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results\nfrom a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting\ncircuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems.\nFinally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC\nregimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and\nquantum computation.\n\nPublished: 2018-05-10\nTitle: Quantum Machine Learning\nAuthors: Jacob Biamonte, Peter Wittek, Nicola Pancotti, Patrick Rebentrost, Nathan Wiebe, Seth Lloyd\nSummary: Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine\nlearning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data.\nSince quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns believed not to be\nefficiently produced by classical systems, it is reasonable to postulate that\nquantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks.\nThe field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement\nconcrete quantum software that offers such advantages. Recent work has made\nclear that the hardware and software challenges are still considerable but has\nalso opened paths towards solutions."}

This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Summarize the findings related to recent advancements in quantum computing..

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Based on the findings from arxiv, summarize the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic..

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Based on the gathered articles, write a summarization of the economic impacts during 2020 to 2022..

We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-19\nTitle: Techno-economic analysis of renewable energy generation at the South Pole\nAuthors: Susan Babinec, Ian Baring-Gould, Amy N. Bender, Nate Blair, Xiangkun Li, Ralph T. Muehleisen, Dan Olis, Silvana Ovaitt\nSummary: Transitioning from fossil-fuel power generation to renewable energy\ngeneration and energy storage in remote locations has the potential to reduce\nboth carbon emissions and cost. This study presents a techno-economic analysis\nfor implementation of a hybrid renewable energy system at the South Pole in\nAntarctica, which currently hosts several high-energy physics experiments with\nnontrivial power needs. A tailored model of resource availability and economics\nfor solar photovoltaics, wind turbine generators, lithium-ion energy storage,\nand long-duration energy storage at this site is explored in different\ncombinations with and without existing diesel energy generation. The Renewable\nEnergy Integration and Optimization (REopt) platform is used to determine the\noptimal system component sizing and the associated system economics and\nenvironmental benefit. We find that the least-cost system includes all three\nenergy generation sources and lithium-ion energy storage. For an example\nsteady-state load of 170 kW, this hybrid system includes 180 kW-DC of\nphotovoltaic panels, 570 kW of wind turbines, and a 3.4 MWh lithium-ion battery\nenergy storage system. This system reduces diesel consumption by 95% compared\nto an all-diesel configuration, resulting in approximately 1200 metric tons of\ncarbon footprint avoided annually. Over the course of a 15-year analysis period\nthe reduced diesel usage leads to a net savings of 57 million United States\ndollars, with a time to payback of approximately two years.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 4, you need to Summarize the gathered research findings on the economic impacts of the pandemic..

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 5, you need to Based on the gathered information, write a summarization.

Dahleh\nSummary: A key obstacle to increasing renewable energy penetration in the power grid\nis the lack of utility-scale storage capacity. Transportation electrification\nhas the potential to overcome this obstacle since Electric Vehicles (EVs) that\nare not in transit can provide battery storage as a service to the grid. This\nis referred to as EV-Power grid integration, and could potentially be a key\nmilestone in the pathway to decarbonize the electricity and the transportation\nsectors. We first show that if EV-Power grid integration is not done carefully,\nthen contrary to improving the cost efficiency of operating the grid, it could\nin fact be counterproductive to it. This fundamentally occurs due to two\nphenomena operating in tandem - the randomness of EV usage patterns and the\npossibility of strategic behavior by EV operators. We present a market-based\nsolution to address this issue. Specifically, we develop a mechanism for energy\nstorage markets using which the system operator can efficiently integrate a\nfleet of strategic EVs with random usage patterns into the grid, utilize them\nfor storage, and satisfy the demand at minimum possible cost.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece Kayacık, Albert H.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'At step 5, you need to Summarize the findings from the gathered information.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively.

Solano\nSummary: Recent experiments have demonstrated that light and matter can mix together\nto an extreme degree, and previously uncharted regimes of light-matter\ninteractions are currently being explored in a variety of settings. The\nso-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the\nlight-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare\nfrequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction\nstrengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling\n(DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and\nDSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting\nwith two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical\nprogress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent\ndevelopments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results\nfrom a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting\ncircuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems.\nFinally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC\nregimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and\nquantum computation.\n\nPublished: 2018-05-10\nTitle: Quantum Machine Learning\nAuthors: Jacob Biamonte, Peter Wittek, Nicola Pancotti, Patrick Rebentrost, Nathan Wiebe, Seth Lloyd\nSummary: Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine\nlearning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data.\nSince quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns believed not to be\nefficiently produced by classical systems, it is reasonable to postulate that\nquantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks.\nThe field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement\nconcrete quantum software that offers such advantages.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Devitt\nSummary: Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n\nPublished: 2020-01-28\nTitle: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): A Survey of Recent Studies on Signal Sensing Technologies and Computational Intelligence Approaches and their Applications\nAuthors: Xiaotong Gu, Zehong Cao, Alireza Jolfaei, Peng Xu, Dongrui Wu, Tzyy-Ping Jung, Chin-Teng Lin\nSummary: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a powerful communication tool between users\nand systems, which enhances the capability of the human brain in communicating\nand interacting with the environment directly. Advances in neuroscience and\ncomputer science in the past decades have led to exciting developments in BCI,\nthereby making BCI a top interdisciplinary research area in computational\nneuroscience and intelligence. Recent technological advances such as wearable\nsensing devices, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and deep learning\napproaches have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI\nfor translational and healthcare applications. Many people benefit from\nEEG-based BCIs, which facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in\ncognitive states under monotonous tasks in the workplace or at home. In this\nstudy, we survey the recent literature of EEG signal sensing technologies and\ncomputational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensated for the\ngaps in the systematic summary of the past five years (2015-2019). In specific,\nwe first review the current status of BCI and its significant obstacles. Then,\nwe present advanced signal sensing and enhancement technologies to collect and\nclean EEG signals, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate state-of-art\ncomputational intelligence techniques, including interpretable fuzzy models,\ntransfer learning, deep learning, and combinations, to monitor, maintain, or\ntrack human cognitive states and operating performance in prevalent\napplications.

To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-19\nTitle: Techno-economic analysis of renewable energy generation at the South Pole\nAuthors: Susan Babinec, Ian Baring-Gould, Amy N. Bender, Nate Blair, Xiangkun Li, Ralph T. Muehleisen, Dan Olis, Silvana Ovaitt\nSummary: Transitioning from fossil-fuel power generation to renewable energy\ngeneration and energy storage in remote locations has the potential to reduce\nboth carbon emissions and cost. This study presents a techno-economic analysis\nfor implementation of a hybrid renewable energy system at the South Pole in\nAntarctica, which currently hosts several high-energy physics experiments with\nnontrivial power needs. A tailored model of resource availability and economics\nfor solar photovoltaics, wind turbine generators, lithium-ion energy storage,\nand long-duration energy storage at this site is explored in different\ncombinations with and without existing diesel energy generation. The Renewable\nEnergy Integration and Optimization (REopt) platform is used to determine the\noptimal system component sizing and the associated system economics and\nenvironmental benefit. We find that the least-cost system includes all three\nenergy generation sources and lithium-ion energy storage. For an example\nsteady-state load of 170 kW, this hybrid system includes 180 kW-DC of\nphotovoltaic panels, 570 kW of wind turbines, and a 3.4 MWh lithium-ion battery\nenergy storage system. This system reduces diesel consumption by 95% compared\nto an all-diesel configuration, resulting in approximately 1200 metric tons of\ncarbon footprint avoided annually. Over the course of a 15-year analysis period\nthe reduced diesel usage leads to a net savings of 57 million United States\ndollars, with a time to payback of approximately two years. All the scenarios\nmodeled show that the transition to renewables is highly cost effective under\nthe unique economics and constraints of this extremely remote site.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE).

To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy. One of the main challenges in designing\nsuch a system is to ensure that energy demand is met while minimizing cost and\nreducing environmental impact. To address this challenge, several strategies\nincluding microgrid systems consisting of offshore wind turbines, wave energy\nconverters, tidal energy converters, floating photovoltaic systems and battery\nenergy storage systems are being proposed. In this paper, cost optimization for\nsizing these renewable energy sources is investigated. A cost optimization\nrenewable sizing (CORS) model is proposed to optimize the sizes of the\ngeneration and storage resources. The proposed CORS model considers the\nvariability of the power outputs of various renewable energy sources and load,\nas well as the cost of different generation technologies and the energy storage\nsystem. Simulations conducted on three test systems show the proposed resource\nsizing method significantly reduces the total lifetime cost of energy while\nmaintaining a high level of reliability and sustainability.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-19\nTitle: Techno-economic analysis of renewable energy generation at the South Pole\nAuthors: Susan Babinec, Ian Baring-Gould, Amy N. Bender, Nate Blair, Xiangkun Li, Ralph T. Muehleisen, Dan Olis, Silvana Ovaitt\nSummary: Transitioning from fossil-fuel power generation to renewable energy\ngeneration and energy storage in remote locations has the potential to reduce\nboth carbon emissions and cost. This study presents a techno-economic analysis\nfor implementation of a hybrid renewable energy system at the South Pole in\nAntarctica, which currently hosts several high-energy physics experiments with\nnontrivial power needs. A tailored model of resource availability and economics\nfor solar photovoltaics, wind turbine generators, lithium-ion energy storage,\nand long-duration energy storage at this site is explored in different\ncombinations with and without existing diesel energy generation. The Renewable\nEnergy Integration and Optimization (REopt) platform is used to determine the\noptimal system component sizing and the associated system economics and\nenvironmental benefit. We find that the least-cost system includes all three\nenergy generation sources and lithium-ion energy storage. For an example\nsteady-state load of 170 kW, this hybrid system includes 180 kW-DC of\nphotovoltaic panels, 570 kW of wind turbines, and a 3.4 MWh lithium-ion battery\nenergy storage system. This system reduces diesel consumption by 95% compared\nto an all-diesel configuration, resulting in approximately 1200 metric tons of\ncarbon footprint avoided annually. Over the course of a 15-year analysis period\nthe reduced diesel usage leads to a net savings of 57 million United States\ndollars, with a time to payback of approximately two years. All the scenarios\nmodeled show that the transition to renewables is highly cost effective under\nthe unique economics and constraints of this extremely remote site.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-20\nTitle: Levelized Cost of Energy for PV and Grid Scale Energy Storage Systems\nAuthors: Chun Sing Lai, Malcolm D McCulloch\nSummary: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy\nstorage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of\nthe system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). In this paper a new\nmetric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for\nthe energy storage.

However, challenges such as initial costs and material dependence highlight areas for innovation and sustainable practices in future developments. Hybrid systems offer a robust solution by maximizing renewable output and minimizing reliance on fossil fuels, though they also come with increased complexity and maintenance considerations. Exploring advancements in supercapacitors and thermal storage could further enhance energy storage solutions in upcoming research.'}

To limit their contribution to climate change,\na proposed solution is to replace the traditional fossil fuel based energy\nresources with offshore clean energy.

Innovations in thermal storage, including advanced phase change materials, enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of energy storage, allowing for heating and cooling applications in residential and industrial settings. This technology is particularly advantageous for concentrating solar power plants.\n\n#### 4. **Supercapacitors**\nWhile not a replacement for batteries, supercapacitors provide rapid delivery of energy and can be charged quickly, making them ideal for applications requiring short bursts of power. Ongoing research is focused on enhancing their energy density to make them more viable for longer-duration applications, potentially complementing battery systems in renewable energy contexts.\n\n#### 5. **Hydrogen Storage**\nThe conversion of surplus renewable energy into hydrogen through electrolysis presents a promising avenue for long-term energy storage. Innovations in hydrogen storage technology aim to improve the efficiency and safety of hydrogen production, storage, and distribution, positioning hydrogen as a key player in the transition to clean energy systems and decarbonization strategies.\n\n#### 6. **Artificial Intelligence and Energy Management Systems**\nEmerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are enabling more efficient management and optimization of energy storage systems. AI-driven algorithms can predict energy demand and generation patterns, assisting with real-time decision-making for energy dispatch and charge/discharge cycles, thus maximizing the utilization of energy storage resources.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe landscape of energy storage is rapidly evolving, driven by technological advancements and innovative solutions. As more efficient and sustainable storage methods emerge, they will address critical challenges associated with the integration of renewable energy sources, ultimately facilitating a smoother transition to a cleaner and more resilient energy future. Ongoing research and investment in these technologies are crucial for maximizing their potential and ensuring broad-scale adoption.'}
