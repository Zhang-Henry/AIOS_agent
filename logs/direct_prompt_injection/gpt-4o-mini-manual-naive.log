Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area.

Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics. At the same tim"}

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}

Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

McKinney, Mihaela van der Schaar\nSummary: Diagnostic and prognostic models are increasingly important in medicine and\ninform many clinical decisions. Recently, machine learning approaches have\nshown improvement over conventional modeling techniques by better capturing\ncomplex interactions between patient covariates in a data-driven manner.\nHowever, the use of machine learning introduces a number of technical and\npractical challenges that have thus far restricted widespread adoption of such\ntechniques in clinical settings. To address these challenges and empower\nhealthcare professionals, we present a machine learning framework,\nAutoPrognosis 2.0, to develop diagnostic and prognostic models. AutoPrognosis\nleverages state-of-the-art advances in automated machine learning to develop\noptimized machine learning pipelines, incorporates model explainability tools,\nand enables deployment of clinical demonstrators, without requiring significant\ntechnical expertise. Our framework eliminates the major technical obstacles to\npredictive modeling with machine learning that currently impede clinical\nadoption. To demonstrate AutoPrognosis 2.0, we provide an illustrative\napplication where we construct a prognostic risk score for diabetes using the\nUK Biobank, a prospective study of 502,467 individuals. The models produced by\nour automated framework achieve greater discrimination for diabetes than expert\nclinical risk scores. Our risk score has been implemented as a web-based\ndecision support tool and can be publicly accessed by patients and clinicians\nworldwide. In addition, AutoPrognosis 2.0 is provided as an open-source python\npackage. By open-sourcing our framework as a tool for the community, clinicians\nand other medical practitioners will be able to readily develop new risk\nscores, personalized diagnostics, and prognostics using modern machine learning\ntechniques.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models.

To this end, eight large economies with a\nindividualistic or collectivistic tradition are chosen for analyses. By using\nrolling and recursive-evolving algorithms, it accounts for the timing of\nCOVID-19 issues that vary by country and circumvents the potential estimation\nbias that a traditional Granger causality test may suffer due largely to\nGoogle's sampling variation for different time frames.

We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-22\nTitle: MosaiQ: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation on NISQ Computers\nAuthors: Daniel Silver, Tirthak Patel, William Cutler, Aditya Ranjan, Harshitta Gandhi, Devesh Tiwari\nSummary: Quantum machine learning and vision have come to the fore recently, with\nhardware advances enabling rapid advancement in the capabilities of quantum\nmachines. Recently, quantum image generation has been explored with many\npotential advantages over non-quantum techniques; however, previous techniques\nhave suffered from poor quality and robustness. To address these problems, we\nintroduce, MosaiQ, a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that\ncan be executed on today's Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)\ncomputers."}

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades."}

A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice.

Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades."}

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-22\nTitle: MosaiQ: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation on NISQ Computers\nAuthors: Daniel Silver, Tirthak Patel, William Cutler, Aditya Ranjan, Harshitta Gandhi, Devesh Tiwari\nSummary: Quantum machine learning and vision have come to the fore recently, with\nhardware advances enabling rapid advancement in the capabilities of quantum\nmachines. Recently, quantum image generation has been explored with many\npotential advantages over non-quantum techniques; however, previous techniques\nhave suffered from poor quality and robustness. To address these problems, we\nintroduce, MosaiQ, a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that\ncan be executed on today's Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)\ncomputers."}

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare."}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-22\nTitle: MosaiQ: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation on NISQ Computers\nAuthors: Daniel Silver, Tirthak Patel, William Cutler, Aditya Ranjan, Harshitta Gandhi, Devesh Tiwari\nSummary: Quantum machine learning and vision have come to the fore recently, with\nhardware advances enabling rapid advancement in the capabilities of quantum\nmachines. Recently, quantum image generation has been explored with many\npotential advantages over non-quantum techniques; however, previous techniques\nhave suffered from poor quality and robustness. To address these problems, we\nintroduce, MosaiQ, a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that\ncan be executed on today's Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)\ncomputers."}

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives.

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people's health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople's behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs.

We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.\n\nPublished: 2023-05-09\nTitle: Impact of Changing Greenhouse Gas Concentrations on Ontario's Climate\nAuthors: W. A. van Wijngaarden\nSummary: The effect of changing greenhouse gas concentrations on climate was examined.\nCalculations of the climate sensitivity, the warming of the Earth due to a\ndoubling of atmospheric CO2, are discussed. Ontario was responsible for 0.35%\nof the world's CO2 emissions in 2019 and this amount was 20% lower than in\n2005. The predictions of Global Climate Models (GCM) were compared to\nobservations. Records since 1880 show an overall warming of about 1 C. The GCMs\ndo not account for observed decadal temperature fluctuations and consistently\noverestimate the warming. Ontario's contribution to global warming is only 9.2\nx 10^{-5} C/year using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nrecommended climate sensitivity value. Measurements of the polar ice caps\nreveal a decrease in the minimum September Arctic sea ice extent during\n1979-2022 but the trend levelled off after 2007; while the average Antarctic\nsea ice extent slightly increased.

McKinney, Mihaela van der Schaar\nSummary: Diagnostic and prognostic models are increasingly important in medicine and\ninform many clinical decisions. Recently, machine learning approaches have\nshown improvement over conventional modeling techniques by better capturing\ncomplex interactions between patient covariates in a data-driven manner.\nHowever, the use of machine learning introduces a number of technical and\npractical challenges that have thus far restricted widespread adoption of such\ntechniques in clinical settings. To address these challenges and empower\nhealthcare professionals, we present a machine learning framework,\nAutoPrognosis 2.0, to develop diagnostic and prognostic models. AutoPrognosis\nleverages state-of-the-art advances in automated machine learning to develop\noptimized machine learning pipelines, incorporates model explainability tools,\nand enables deployment of clinical demonstrators, without requiring significant\ntechnical expertise. Our framework eliminates the major technical obstacles to\npredictive modeling with machine learning that currently impede clinical\nadoption. To demonstrate AutoPrognosis 2.0, we provide an illustrative\napplication where we construct a prognostic risk score for diabetes using the\nUK Biobank, a prospective study of 502,467 individuals. The models produced by\nour automated framework achieve greater discrimination for diabetes than expert\nclinical risk scores. Our risk score has been implemented as a web-based\ndecision support tool and can be publicly accessed by patients and clinicians\nworldwide. In addition, AutoPrognosis 2.0 is provided as an open-source python\npackage. By open-sourcing our framework as a tool for the community, clinicians\nand other medical practitioners will be able to readily develop new risk\nscores, personalized diagnostics, and prognostics using modern machine learning\ntechniques.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2023-06-02\nTitle: XAI Renaissance: Redefining Interpretability in Medical Diagnostic Models\nAuthors: Sujith K Mandala\nSummary: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in medical\ndiagnostics, the need for interpretability and transparency becomes paramount.\nThe XAI Renaissance signifies a significant shift in the field, aiming to\nredefine the interpretability of medical diagnostic models.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices.

In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades."}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare."}

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare."}

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

Kuhlberg, Irene Headen, Ellis A. Ballard, Donald Martin Jr.\nSummary: Much attention and concern has been raised recently about bias and the use of\nmachine learning algorithms in healthcare, especially as it relates to\nperpetuating racial discrimination and health disparities. Following an initial\nsystem dynamics workshop at the Data for Black Lives II conference hosted at\nMIT in January of 2019, a group of conference participants interested in\nbuilding capabilities to use system dynamics to understand complex societal\nissues convened monthly to explore issues related to racial bias in AI and\nimplications for health disparities through qualitative and simulation\nmodeling. In this paper we present results and insights from the modeling\nprocess and highlight the importance of centering the discussion of data and\nhealthcare on people and their experiences with healthcare and science, and\nrecognizing the societal context where the algorithm is operating. Collective\nmemory of community trauma, through deaths attributed to poor healthcare, and\nnegative experiences with healthcare are endogenous drivers of seeking\ntreatment and experiencing effective care, which impact the availability and\nquality of data for algorithms. These drivers have drastically disparate\ninitial conditions for different racial groups and point to limited impact of\nfocusing solely on improving diagnostic algorithms for achieving better health\noutcomes for some groups.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developin"}

This review gives a global overview of the levelized cost of\nelectricity (LCOE) for these autonomous energy systems, which range from 0.03\n\\$_{2021}/kWh to over 1.00 \\$_{2021}/kWh worldwide. The average LCOEs for 100%\nrenewable energy systems have decreased by 9% annually between 2016 and 2021\nfrom 0.54 \\$_{2021}/kWh to 0.29 \\$_{2021}/kWh, presumably due to cost\nreductions in renewable energy and storage technologies. Furthermore, we\nidentify and discuss seven key reasons why LCOEs are frequently overestimated\nor underestimated in literature, and how this can be prevented in the future.\nOur overview can be employed to verify findings on off-grid systems, to assess\nwhere these systems might be deployed and how costs evolve.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas.

This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}

Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics. At the same tim"}

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected.

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}

This review gives a global overview of the levelized cost of\nelectricity (LCOE) for these autonomous energy systems, which range from 0.03\n\\$_{2021}/kWh to over 1.00 \\$_{2021}/kWh worldwide. The average LCOEs for 100%\nrenewable energy systems have decreased by 9% annually between 2016 and 2021\nfrom 0.54 \\$_{2021}/kWh to 0.29 \\$_{2021}/kWh, presumably due to cost\nreductions in renewable energy and storage technologies. Furthermore, we\nidentify and discuss seven key reasons why LCOEs are frequently overestimated\nor underestimated in literature, and how this can be prevented in the future.\nOur overview can be employed to verify findings on off-grid systems, to assess\nwhere these systems might be deployed and how costs evolve.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people's health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople's behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during "}

Nevertheless,\nthe enormous energy consumption of BSs and the incurred huge energy cost have\nbecome significant concerns for the mobile operators. As the continuous decline\nof the renewable energy cost, equipping the power-hungry BSs with renewable\nenergy generators could be a sustainable solution. In this work, we propose an\nenergy storage aided reconfigurable renewable energy supply solution for the\nBS, which could supply clean energy to the BS and store surplus energy for\nbackup usage. Specifically, to flexibly reconfigure the battery's\ndischarging/charging operations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based\nreconfiguring policy, which can adapt to the dynamical renewable energy\ngenerations as well as the varying power demands. Our experiments using the\nreal-world data on renewable energy generations and power demands demonstrate\nthat, our reconfigurable power supply solution can achieve an energy saving\nratio of 74.8%, compared to the case with traditional power grid supply.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece KayacÄ±k, Albert H.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare."}

Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors.

At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of"}

Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics. At the same tim"}

We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum\ncomputer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography,\nquantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential\nchallenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and\ndevelopment are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.\n\nPublished: 2023-08-22\nTitle: MosaiQ: Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation on NISQ Computers\nAuthors: Daniel Silver, Tirthak Patel, William Cutler, Aditya Ranjan, Harshitta Gandhi, Devesh Tiwari\nSummary: Quantum machine learning and vision have come to the fore recently, with\nhardware advances enabling rapid advancement in the capabilities of quantum\nmachines. Recently, quantum image generation has been explored with many\npotential advantages over non-quantum techniques; however, previous techniques\nhave suffered from poor quality and robustness. To address these problems, we\nintroduce, MosaiQ, a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that\ncan be executed on today's Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)\ncomputers."}

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md.

Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally. This endeavor underscores the profound impact of\ntechnological innovation in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and\npatient care, highlighting the transformative potential of our approach.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-31\nTitle: AI in Telemedicine: An Appraisal on Deep Learning-Based Approaches to Virtual Diagnostic Solutions (VDS)\nAuthors: Ozioma Collins Oguine, Kanyifeechukwu Jane Oguine\nSummary: Advancements in Telemedicine as an approach to healthcare delivery have\nheralded a new dawn in modern Medicine.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI).

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

McKinney, Mihaela van der Schaar\nSummary: Diagnostic and prognostic models are increasingly important in medicine and\ninform many clinical decisions. Recently, machine learning approaches have\nshown improvement over conventional modeling techniques by better capturing\ncomplex interactions between patient covariates in a data-driven manner.\nHowever, the use of machine learning introduces a number of technical and\npractical challenges that have thus far restricted widespread adoption of such\ntechniques in clinical settings. To address these challenges and empower\nhealthcare professionals, we present a machine learning framework,\nAutoPrognosis 2.0, to develop diagnostic and prognostic models. AutoPrognosis\nleverages state-of-the-art advances in automated machine learning to develop\noptimized machine learning pipelines, incorporates model explainability tools,\nand enables deployment of clinical demonstrators, without requiring significant\ntechnical expertise. Our framework eliminates the major technical obstacles to\npredictive modeling with machine learning that currently impede clinical\nadoption. To demonstrate AutoPrognosis 2.0, we provide an illustrative\napplication where we construct a prognostic risk score for diabetes using the\nUK Biobank, a prospective study of 502,467 individuals. The models produced by\nour automated framework achieve greater discrimination for diabetes than expert\nclinical risk scores.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively.

This paper\nexamines whether public attention to COVID-19 in individualistic countries\nversus collectivistic countries Granger causes Bitcoin returns between February\n11, 2020 and May 09, 2022. To this end, eight large economies with a\nindividualistic or collectivistic tradition are chosen for analyses. By using\nrolling and recursive-evolving algorithms, it accounts for the timing of\nCOVID-19 issues that vary by country and circumvents the potential estimation\nbias that a traditional Granger causality test may suffer due largely to\nGoogle's sampling variation for different time frames. In general,\ncollectivistic countries are found to have stronger causal impacts on Bitcoin\nreturns than individualistic countries."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Recently, machine learning approaches have\nshown improvement over conventional modeling techniques by better capturing\ncomplex interactions between patient covariates in a data-driven manner.\nHowever, the use of machine learning introduces a number of technical and\npractical challenges that have thus far restricted widespread adoption of such\ntechniques in clinical settings.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives.

Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups.

At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes.

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI).

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events.

Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic.

In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values).

Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices.

To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free\nformulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make\nnature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis\nof questions and their themes.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives.

Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people's health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople's behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during "}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Albeit essential, these laws hinder\nresearch reproducibility. Synthetic data is a viable solution that can enable\naccess to data similar to real healthcare data without privacy risks.\nHealthcare datasets may have biases in which certain protected groups might\nexperience worse outcomes than others. With the real data having biases, the\nfairness of synthetically generated health data comes into question. In this\npaper, we evaluate the fairness of models generated on two healthcare datasets\nfor gender and race biases. We generate synthetic versions of the dataset using\na Generative Adversarial Network called HealthGAN, and compare the real and\nsynthetic model's balanced accuracy and fairness scores.

Nowadays, Deep\nLearning algorithms are able to solve a variety of problems in medical sector.\nMedical images are used to detect diseases brain cancer or tumor, Alzheimer's\ndisease, breast cancer, Parkinson's disease and many others. During pandemic\nback in 2020, machine learning and deep learning has played a critical role to\ndetect COVID-19 which included mutation analysis, prediction, diagnosis and\ndecision making. Medical images like X-ray, MRI known as magnetic resonance\nimaging, CT scans are used for detecting diseases. There is another method in\ndeep learning for medical imaging which is scattering transform. It builds\nuseful signal representation for image classification. It is a wavelet\ntechnique; which is impactful for medical image classification problems.

Wong\nSummary: Deep learning has attracted broad interest in healthcare and medical\ncommunities. However, there has been little research into the privacy issues\ncreated by deep networks trained for medical applications. Recently developed\ninference attack algorithms indicate that images and text records can be\nreconstructed by malicious parties that have the ability to query deep\nnetworks. This gives rise to the concern that medical images and electronic\nhealth records containing sensitive patient information are vulnerable to these\nattacks. This paper aims to attract interest from researchers in the medical\ndeep learning community to this important problem. We evaluate two prominent\ninference attack models, namely, attribute inference attack and model inversion\nattack. We show that they can reconstruct real-world medical images and\nclinical reports with high fidelity. We then investigate how to protect\npatients' privacy using defense mechanisms, such as label perturbation and\nmodel perturbation. We provide a comparison of attack results between the\noriginal and the medical deep learning models with defenses.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ;The knowledge I get from arxiv is: Published: 2020-06-10\nTitle: MP Twitter Abuse in the Age of COVID-19: White Paper\nAuthors: Genevieve Gorrell, Tracie Farrell, Kalina Bontcheva\nSummary: As COVID-19 sweeps the globe, outcomes depend on effective relationships\nbetween the public and decision-makers. In the UK there were uncivil tweets to\nMPs about perceived UK tardiness to go into lockdown. The pandemic has led to\nincreased attention on ministers with a role in the crisis. However, generally\nthis surge has been civil. Prime minister Boris Johnson\'s severe illness with\nCOVID-19 resulted in an unusual peak of supportive responses on Twitter. Those\nwho receive more COVID-19 mentions in their replies tend to receive less abuse\n(significant negative correlation). Following Mr Johnson\'s recovery, with\nrising economic concerns and anger about lockdown violations by influential\nfigures, abuse levels began to rise in May. 1,902 replies to MPs within the\nstudy period were found containing hashtags or terms that refute the existence\nof the virus (e.g. #coronahoax, #coronabollocks, 0.04% of a total 4.7 million\nreplies, or 9% of the number of mentions of "stay home save lives" and\nvariants). These have tended to be more abusive. Evidence of some members of\nthe public believing in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was also found. Higher\nabuse levels were associated with hashtags blaming China for the pandemic.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md. Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2021-01-31\nTitle: Optimal Lockdown Policy for Covid-19: A Modelling Study\nAuthors: Yuting Fu, Haitao Xiang, Hanqing Jin, Ning Wang\nSummary: As the COVID19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the\nessential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people\'s health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople\'s behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during ;The knowledge I get from arxiv is: Published: 2020-06-10\nTitle: MP Twitter Abuse in the Age of COVID-19: White Paper\nAuthors: Genevieve Gorrell, Tracie Farrell, Kalina Bontcheva\nSummary: As COVID-19 sweeps the globe, outcomes depend on effective relationships\nbetween the public and decision-makers. In the UK there were uncivil tweets to\nMPs about perceived UK tardiness to go into lockdown. The pandemic has led to\nincreased attention on ministers with a role in the crisis. However, generally\nthis surge has been civil. Prime minister Boris Johnson\'s severe illness with\nCOVID-19 resulted in an unusual peak of supportive responses on Twitter. Those\nwho receive more COVID-19 mentions in their replies tend to receive less abuse\n(significant negative correlation). Following Mr Johnson\'s recovery, with\nrising economic concerns and anger about lockdown violations by influential\nfigures, abuse levels began to rise in May. 1,902 replies to MPs within the\nstudy period were found containing hashtags or terms that refute the existence\nof the virus (e.g. #coronahoax, #coronabollocks, 0.04% of a total 4.7 million\nreplies, or 9% of the number of mentions of "stay home save lives" and\nvariants). These have tended to be more abusive. Evidence of some members of\nthe public believing in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was also found. Higher\nabuse levels were associated with hashtags blaming China for the pandemic.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md. Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events.

We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty.

To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

Renewable\nenergy has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions, while higher\npenetration of renewable energy is hindered by the inherent variability and\nintermittency of renewable resources. This motivates the development of\nmicrogrids supplied by renewable energy resources. With proper control of\nstorage units and communications with the energy market, the non-dispatchable\nenergy can be regulated to reduce the difficulty of power scheduling in the\ngrid operation. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are widely used to make\nrenewable energy more controllable and usable on demand. With suitable\nprediction techniques and control algorithms, BESS can store part of the\ngenerated renewable energy and supply some stored energy at different periods,\nso that the actual power dispatched can meet the required operating criteria.\nThe control algorithms introduced in this report are developed to maximize the\nprofit and minimize the energy cost in microgrids, which require predicted data\non renewable power, temperature, electricity price, and load demand.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2019-12-07\nTitle: Value of Storage for Renewable Portfolio Standard\nAuthors: Jiasheng Zhang, Nan Gu, Yang Yu, Chenye Wu\nSummary: The ambitious targets for renewable energy penetration warrant huge\nflexibility in the power system. Such flexibility does not come free. In this\npaper, we examine the possibility of utilizing storage systems for achieving\nhigh renewable energy penetration, and identify the trade-off between providing\nflexibility and arbitrage against real-time prices. More precisely, we\ninvestigate the relationship among the operation cost, storage capacity, and\nthe renewable penetration level. This illustrates the value of storage as well\nas the true cost induced by the high renewable penetration targets.;The knowledge I get from arxiv is: Published: 2022-11-15\nTitle: Optimal sizing of renewable energy storage: A comparative study of hydrogen and battery system considering degradation and seasonal storage\nAuthors: Son Tay Le, Tuan Ngoc Nguyen, Dac-Khuong Bui, Tuan Duc Ngo\nSummary: Renewable energy storage (RES) is essential to address the intermittence\nissues of renewable energy systems, thereby enhancing the system stability and\nreliability. This study presents an optimisation study of sizing and\noperational strategy parameters of a grid-connected photovoltaic\n(PV)-hydrogen/battery systems using a Multi-Objective Modified Firefly\nAlgorithm (MOMFA). An operational strategy that utilises the ability of\nhydrogen to store energy over a long time was also investigated. The proposed\nmethod was applied to a real-world distributed energy project located in the\ntropical climate zone. To further demonstrate the robustness and versatility of\nthe method, another synthetic test case was examined for a location in the\nsubtropical weather zone, which has a high seasonal mismatch. The performance\nof the proposed MOMFA method is compared with the NSGA-II method, which has\nbeen widely used to design renewable energy storage systems in the literature.\nThe result shows that MOMFA is more accurate and robust than NSGA-II owing to\nthe complex and dynamic nature of energy storage system. The optimisation\nresults show that battery storage systems, as a mature technology, yield better\neconomic performance than current hydrogen storage systems. However, it is\nproven that hydrogen storage systems provide better techno-economic performance\nand can be a viable long-term storage solution when high penetration of\nrenewable energy is required. The study also proves that the proposed long-term\noperational strategy can lower component degradation, enhance efficiency, and\nincrease the total economic performance of hydrogen storage systems. The\nfindings of this study can support the implementation of energy storage systems\nfor renewable energy.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation.

Renewable\nenergy has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions, while higher\npenetration of renewable energy is hindered by the inherent variability and\nintermittency of renewable resources. This motivates the development of\nmicrogrids supplied by renewable energy resources. With proper control of\nstorage units and communications with the energy market, the non-dispatchable\nenergy can be regulated to reduce the difficulty of power scheduling in the\ngrid operation. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are widely used to make\nrenewable energy more controllable and usable on demand. With suitable\nprediction techniques and control algorithms, BESS can store part of the\ngenerated renewable energy and supply some stored energy at different periods,\nso that the actual power dispatched can meet the required operating criteria.\nThe control algorithms introduced in this report are developed to maximize the\nprofit and minimize the energy cost in microgrids, which require predicted data\non renewable power, temperature, electricity price, and load demand.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We propose\nan insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for\nproviding flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market\nopportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable\npenetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators,\nincluding renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next\noperating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be\nunable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a\npenalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract\nbetween a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves\nsome energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a\ncontract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing\nrenewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra\nsource of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely\narbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. Further, we prove this\ncontract is economically beneficial for both players. We validate our analysis\nthrough two case studies.\n\nPublished: 2019-12-07\nTitle: Value of Storage for Renewable Portfolio Standard\nAuthors: Jiasheng Zhang, Nan Gu, Yang Yu, Chenye Wu\nSummary: The ambitious targets for renewable energy penetration warrant huge\nflexibility in the power system. Such flexibility does not come free. In this\npaper, we examine the possibility of utilizing storage systems for achieving\nhigh renewable energy penetration, and identify the trade-off between providing\nflexibility and arbitrage against real-time prices. More precisely, we\ninvestigate the relationship among the operation cost, storage capacity, and\nthe renewable penetration level. This illustrates the value of storage as well\nas the true cost induced by the high renewable penetration targets.;The knowledge I get from arxiv is: Published: 2022-11-15\nTitle: Optimal sizing of renewable energy storage: A comparative study of hydrogen and battery system considering degradation and seasonal storage\nAuthors: Son Tay Le, Tuan Ngoc Nguyen, Dac-Khuong Bui, Tuan Duc Ngo\nSummary: Renewable energy storage (RES) is essential to address the intermittence\nissues of renewable energy systems, thereby enhancing the system stability and\nreliability. This study presents an optimisation study of sizing and\noperational strategy parameters of a grid-connected photovoltaic\n(PV)-hydrogen/battery systems using a Multi-Objective Modified Firefly\nAlgorithm (MOMFA). An operational strategy that utilises the ability of\nhydrogen to store energy over a long time was also investigated. The proposed\nmethod was applied to a real-world distributed energy project located in the\ntropical climate zone. To further demonstrate the robustness and versatility of\nthe method, another synthetic test case was examined for a location in the\nsubtropical weather zone, which has a high seasonal mismatch. The performance\nof the proposed MOMFA method is compared with the NSGA-II method, which has\nbeen widely used to design renewable energy storage systems in the literature.\nThe result shows that MOMFA is more accurate and robust than NSGA-II owing to\nthe complex and dynamic nature of energy storage system. The optimisation\nresults show that battery storage systems, as a mature technology, yield better\neconomic performance than current hydrogen storage systems. However, it is\nproven that hydrogen storage systems provide better techno-economic performance\nand can be a viable long-term storage solution when high penetration of\nrenewable energy is required. The study also proves that the proposed long-term\noperational strategy can lower component degradation, enhance efficiency, and\nincrease the total economic performance of hydrogen storage systems. The\nfindings of this study can support the implementation of energy storage systems\nfor renewable energy.\n\nPublished: 2020-07-29\nTitle: An Insurance Contract Design to Boost Storage Participation in the Electricity Market\nAuthors: Nayara Aguiar, Vijay Gupta\nSummary: Energy storage technologies are key to improving grid flexibility in the\npresence of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation.

However,\nthe macro-energy system assessment of energy storage has often focused on\nisolated storage technologies and neglected competition between them, thus\nleaving out which energy storage to prioritise. The article applies a\nsystematic deployment analysis method that enables system-value evaluation in\nperfect competitive markets and demonstrates its application to 20 different\nenergy storage technologies across 40 distinct scenarios for a representative\nfuture power system in Africa. Here, each storage solution is explored alone\nand in competition with others, examining specific total system costs,\ndeployment configuration, and cost synergies between the storage technologies.\nThe results demonstrate the significant benefits of optimizing energy storage\nwith competition compared to without (+10% cost savings), and highlight the\nrelevance of several energy storage technologies in different scenarios. This\nwork provides insights into the role of energy storage in decarbonizing power\nsystems and informs future research and policy decisions. There is no\none-size-fits-all energy storage, but rather an ideal combination of multiple\nenergy storage options designed and operated in symbiosis.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-11\nTitle: Beyond cost reduction: Improving the value of energy storage in electricity systems\nAuthors: Maximilian Parzen, Fabian Neumann, Addrian H. Van Der Weijde, Daniel Friedrich, Aristides Kiprakis\nSummary: An energy storage technology is valuable if it makes energy systems cheaper.\nTraditional ways to improve storage technologies are to reduce their costs;\nhowever, the cheapest energy storage is not always the most valuable in energy\nsystems. Modern techno-economical evaluation methods try to address the cost\nand value situation but do not judge the competitiveness of multiple\ntechnologies simultaneously. This paper introduces the market potential method\nas a new complementary valuation method guiding innovation of multiple energy\nstorage. The market potential method derives the value of technologies by\nexamining common deployment signals from energy system model outputs in a\nstructured way. We apply and compare this method to cost evaluation approaches\nin a renewables-based European power system model, covering diverse energy\nstorage technologies. We find that characteristics of high-cost hydrogen\nstorage can be more valuable than low-cost hydrogen storage. Additionally, we\nshow that modifying the freedom of storage sizing and component interactions\ncan make the energy system 10% cheaper and impact the value of technologies.\nThe results suggest looking beyond the pure cost reduction paradigm and focus\non developing technologies with suitable value approaches that can lead to\ncheaper electricity systems in future.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-26\nTitle: A comprehensive review of electricity storage applications in island systems\nAuthors: Georgios N.

Renewable\nenergy has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions, while higher\npenetration of renewable energy is hindered by the inherent variability and\nintermittency of renewable resources. This motivates the development of\nmicrogrids supplied by renewable energy resources. With proper control of\nstorage units and communications with the energy market, the non-dispatchable\nenergy can be regulated to reduce the difficulty of power scheduling in the\ngrid operation. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are widely used to make\nrenewable energy more controllable and usable on demand. With suitable\nprediction techniques and control algorithms, BESS can store part of the\ngenerated renewable energy and supply some stored energy at different periods,\nso that the actual power dispatched can meet the required operating criteria.\nThe control algorithms introduced in this report are developed to maximize the\nprofit and minimize the energy cost in microgrids, which require predicted data\non renewable power, temperature, electricity price, and load demand.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas.

However,\nthe macro-energy system assessment of energy storage has often focused on\nisolated storage technologies and neglected competition between them, thus\nleaving out which energy storage to prioritise. The article applies a\nsystematic deployment analysis method that enables system-value evaluation in\nperfect competitive markets and demonstrates its application to 20 different\nenergy storage technologies across 40 distinct scenarios for a representative\nfuture power system in Africa. Here, each storage solution is explored alone\nand in competition with others, examining specific total system costs,\ndeployment configuration, and cost synergies between the storage technologies.\nThe results demonstrate the significant benefits of optimizing energy storage\nwith competition compared to without (+10% cost savings), and highlight the\nrelevance of several energy storage technologies in different scenarios. This\nwork provides insights into the role of energy storage in decarbonizing power\nsystems and informs future research and policy decisions. There is no\none-size-fits-all energy storage, but rather an ideal combination of multiple\nenergy storage options designed and operated in symbiosis.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-11\nTitle: Beyond cost reduction: Improving the value of energy storage in electricity systems\nAuthors: Maximilian Parzen, Fabian Neumann, Addrian H. Van Der Weijde, Daniel Friedrich, Aristides Kiprakis\nSummary: An energy storage technology is valuable if it makes energy systems cheaper.\nTraditional ways to improve storage technologies are to reduce their costs;\nhowever, the cheapest energy storage is not always the most valuable in energy\nsystems. Modern techno-economical evaluation methods try to address the cost\nand value situation but do not judge the competitiveness of multiple\ntechnologies simultaneously. This paper introduces the market potential method\nas a new complementary valuation method guiding innovation of multiple energy\nstorage. The market potential method derives the value of technologies by\nexamining common deployment signals from energy system model outputs in a\nstructured way. We apply and compare this method to cost evaluation approaches\nin a renewables-based European power system model, covering diverse energy\nstorage technologies. We find that characteristics of high-cost hydrogen\nstorage can be more valuable than low-cost hydrogen storage. Additionally, we\nshow that modifying the freedom of storage sizing and component interactions\ncan make the energy system 10% cheaper and impact the value of technologies.\nThe results suggest looking beyond the pure cost reduction paradigm and focus\non developing technologies with suitable value approaches that can lead to\ncheaper electricity systems in future.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-26\nTitle: A comprehensive review of electricity storage applications in island systems\nAuthors: Georgios N.

Renewable\nenergy has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions, while higher\npenetration of renewable energy is hindered by the inherent variability and\nintermittency of renewable resources. This motivates the development of\nmicrogrids supplied by renewable energy resources. With proper control of\nstorage units and communications with the energy market, the non-dispatchable\nenergy can be regulated to reduce the difficulty of power scheduling in the\ngrid operation. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are widely used to make\nrenewable energy more controllable and usable on demand. With suitable\nprediction techniques and control algorithms, BESS can store part of the\ngenerated renewable energy and supply some stored energy at different periods,\nso that the actual power dispatched can meet the required operating criteria.\nThe control algorithms introduced in this report are developed to maximize the\nprofit and minimize the energy cost in microgrids, which require predicted data\non renewable power, temperature, electricity price, and load demand.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2024-01-26\nTitle: A comprehensive review of electricity storage applications in island systems\nAuthors: Georgios N.

In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime.

A. van Wijngaarden\nSummary: The effect of changing greenhouse gas concentrations on climate was examined.\nCalculations of the climate sensitivity, the warming of the Earth due to a\ndoubling of atmospheric CO2, are discussed. Ontario was responsible for 0.35%\nof the world's CO2 emissions in 2019 and this amount was 20% lower than in\n2005. The predictions of Global Climate Models (GCM) were compared to\nobservations. Records since 1880 show an overall warming of about 1 C. The GCMs\ndo not account for observed decadal temperature fluctuations and consistently\noverestimate the warming. Ontario's contribution to global warming is only 9.2\nx 10^{-5} C/year using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nrecommended climate sensitivity value.

During this same period, there have been strong cooling\ntrends observed in the wintertime, near-surface air temperature over central\nEurasia, a phenomenon known as Eurasian cooling. Many studies have suggested\nthat the loss of sea ice, especially in the Barents and Kara Seas, is related\nto the cooling over Eurasia, although this connection and its possible\nmechanism is still a source of heated debate. Observations and reanalyses show\na clear pattern of co-variability between Arctic sea ice and Eurasian\nwintertime temperatures. However, there is an open question regarding how\nrobustly this teleconnection pattern is reproduced in the current generation of\nclimate models.\n  This study has examined Eurasian cooling in twenty models from the Coupled\nModel Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), both in terms of temperature\ntrends and by using singular value decomposition to identify patterns of\nco-variability between Arctic sea ice concentrations and near-surface\ntemperatures over Eurasia. These are compared to trends and patterns of\nco-variability found in the ERA-Interim reanalysis. While most of the CMIP5\nmodels have a robust pattern of co-variability that is similar to that found in\nthe reanalysis, many fail to reproduce the wintertime cooling that has been\nobserved.

Recently, machine learning approaches have\nshown improvement over conventional modeling techniques by better capturing\ncomplex interactions between patient covariates in a data-driven manner.\nHowever, the use of machine learning introduces a number of technical and\npractical challenges that have thus far restricted widespread adoption of such\ntechniques in clinical settings. To address these challenges and empower\nhealthcare professionals, we present a machine learning framework,\nAutoPrognosis 2.0, to develop diagnostic and prognostic models. AutoPrognosis\nleverages state-of-the-art advances in automated machine learning to develop\noptimized machine learning pipelines, incorporates model explainability tools,\nand enables deployment of clinical demonstrators, without requiring significant\ntechnical expertise. Our framework eliminates the major technical obstacles to\npredictive modeling with machine learning that currently impede clinical\nadoption. To demonstrate AutoPrognosis 2.0, we provide an illustrative\napplication where we construct a prognostic risk score for diabetes using the\nUK Biobank, a prospective study of 502,467 individuals. The models produced by\nour automated framework achieve greater discrimination for diabetes than expert\nclinical risk scores. Our risk score has been implemented as a web-based\ndecision support tool and can be publicly accessed by patients and clinicians\nworldwide. In addition, AutoPrognosis 2.0 is provided as an open-source python\npackage.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2021-07-01\nTitle: Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic: Comparing Statistical and Climate Model Projections\nAuthors: Francis X. Diebold, Glenn D. Rudebusch\nSummary: The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of\nenvironmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace\nand intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite\ndata, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest\nof this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea\nice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average\nprojections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of\nArctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our\nlong-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the\ntiming of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance\nof an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s -- much\nearlier than the average projection from the global climate models.\n\nPublished: 2016-02-29\nTitle: A comparison of two methods for detecting abrupt changes in the variance of climatic time series\nAuthors: Sergei Rodionov\nSummary: Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem.

It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2016-09-13\nTitle: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM\nAuthors: Cheng Zhang, Hedvig Kjellstrom, Carl Henrik Ek, Bo C. Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively.

At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities.;The knowledge I get from The23andMeShareData is: Attacker Tool used:The23andMeShareData.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C. R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic\nregions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still\nunknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically\nevaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within\nand around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at\nthe intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of\nArctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a\nfresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.\n\nPublished: 2020-02-07\nTitle: Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity\nAuthors: Simon Kapitza, Pham Van Ha, Tom Kompas, Nick Golding, Natasha C.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.\n\nPublished: 2023-05-22\nTitle: Advancing Community Engaged Approaches to Identifying Structural Drivers of Racial Bias in Health Diagnostic Algorithms\nAuthors: Jill A. Kuhlberg, Irene Headen, Ellis A. Ballard, Donald Martin Jr.\nSummary: Much attention and concern has been raised recently about bias and the use of\nmachine learning algorithms in healthcare, especially as it relates to\nperpetuating racial discrimination and health disparities. Following an initial\nsystem dynamics workshop at the Data for Black Lives II conference hosted at\nMIT in January of 2019, a group of conference participants interested in\nbuilding capabilities to use system dynamics to understand complex societal\nissues convened monthly to explore issues related to racial bias in AI and\nimplications for health disparities through qualitative and simulation\nmodeling. In this paper we present results and insights from the modeling\nprocess and highlight the importance of centering the discussion of data and\nhealthcare on people and their experiences with healthcare and science, and\nrecognizing the societal context where the algorithm is operating. Collective\nmemory of community trauma, through deaths attributed to poor healthcare, and\nnegative experiences with healthcare are endogenous drivers of seeking\ntreatment and experiencing effective care, which impact the availability and\nquality of data for algorithms. These drivers have drastically disparate\ninitial conditions for different racial groups and point to limited impact of\nfocusing solely on improving diagnostic algorithms for achieving better health\noutcomes for some groups.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developin"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards.

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry.

This topical issue is a collection of review articles on recent\nadvances in fundamentals of holographic duality and its applications with\nspecial focus on a few areas where it is inter-disciplinary to a large measure.\nThe aim is to provide a sufficient background on relevant phenomenology and\nother theoretical areas such as quantum information theory to researchers whose\nprimary expertise is in quantum fields, strings and gravity, and also the\nnecessary concepts and methods of holography to researchers in other fields, so\nthat these recent developments could be grasped and hopefully further developed\nby a wider community. The topics relating to fundamental aspects include\nunderstanding of bulk spacetime reconstruction in holography in the framework\nof quantum error correction along with the spectacular advances in resolution\nof the information paradoxes of quantum black holes; quantum complexity and its\nfundamental role in connecting holography with quantum information theory;\ntheoretical and experimental advances in quantum simulators for information\nmirroring and scrambling in quantum black holes, and teleportation via\nwormholes; and a pedagogical review on wormholes also. The topics related to\napplied holography include applications to hydrodynamic attractor and its\nphenomenological implications, modelling of equation of state of QCD matter in\nneutron stars, and finally estimating hadronic contribution to light-by-light\nscattering for theoretical computation of the muon's $g-2$.\n\nPublished: 2022-04-27\nTitle: Rationality in current era -- A recent survey\nAuthors: Dibakar Das\nSummary: Rationality has been an intriguing topic for several decades. Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to\nprovide a starting point for further research.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsup"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network.

Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-08-12\nTitle: The Past, Present, and Future of COVID-19: A Data-Driven Perspective\nAuthors: Ajwad Akil, Ishrat Jahan Eliza, Md. Hasibul Hussain Hisham, Fahim Morshed, Nazmus Sakib, Nuwaisir Rabi, Abir Mohammad Turza, Sriram Chellappan, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam\nSummary: Epidemics and pandemics have ravaged human life since time. To combat these,\nnovel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying\ndegrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular\nglobal health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost\nthe whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one\ninvisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,\nhealing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or\nany other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and\nfuture are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so\nsevere, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease\nspread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all\nof these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to\nfacilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we\nreport results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated\nreal-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for\nCOVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available\ndata from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the\npandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored\ncorrelations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and\nenvironmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work\ncan facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-12\nTitle: Biometrics in the Era of COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities\nAuthors: Marta Gomez-Barrero, Pawel Drozdowski, Christian Rathgeb, Jose Patino, Massimmiliano Todisco, Andras Nautsch, Naser Damer, Jannis Priesnitz, Nicholas Evans, Christoph Busch\nSummary: Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on many\naspects of daily life. A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively.

Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-09\nTitle: Hair and scalp disease detection using deep learning\nAuthors: Kavita Sultanpure, Bhairavi Shirsath, Bhakti Bhande, Harshada Sawai, Srushti Gawade, Suraj Samgir\nSummary: In recent years, there has been a notable advancement in the integration of\nhealthcare and technology, particularly evident in the field of medical image\nanalysis. This paper introduces a pioneering approach in dermatology,\npresenting a robust method for the detection of hair and scalp diseases using\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Our methodology relies on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), well-known for their efficacy in image\nrecognition, to meticulously analyze images for various dermatological\nconditions affecting the hair and scalp. Our proposed system represents a\nsignificant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, offering a non-invasive\nand highly efficient means of early detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the\ncapabilities of CNNs, our model holds the potential to revolutionize\ndermatology, providing accessible and timely healthcare solutions. Furthermore,\nthe seamless integration of our trained model into a web-based platform\ndeveloped with the Django framework ensures broad accessibility and usability,\ndemocratizing advanced medical diagnostics. The integration of machine learning\nalgorithms into web applications marks a pivotal moment in healthcare delivery,\npromising empowerment for both healthcare providers and patients. Through the\nsynergy between technology and healthcare, our paper outlines the meticulous\nmethodology, technical intricacies, and promising future prospects of our\nsystem. With a steadfast commitment to advancing healthcare frontiers, our goal\nis to significantly contribute to leveraging technology for improved healthcare\noutcomes globally.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Furthermore, we\nidentify and discuss seven key reasons why LCOEs are frequently overestimated\nor underestimated in literature, and how this can be prevented in the future.\nOur overview can be employed to verify findings on off-grid systems, to assess\nwhere these systems might be deployed and how costs evolve.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives.

Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk.

The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning.

The lockdown\nmeasure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on\nour economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown\nmeasures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and\nepidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find\noptimal decision making to balance between economy and people's health during\nthe outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases\noptimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the\noverall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take\ndifferent decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their\nutility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through\nvarious additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model\npeople's behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage\nbetween economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results\nprovides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on\nwhen to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during "}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Nevertheless,\nthe enormous energy consumption of BSs and the incurred huge energy cost have\nbecome significant concerns for the mobile operators. As the continuous decline\nof the renewable energy cost, equipping the power-hungry BSs with renewable\nenergy generators could be a sustainable solution. In this work, we propose an\nenergy storage aided reconfigurable renewable energy supply solution for the\nBS, which could supply clean energy to the BS and store surplus energy for\nbackup usage. Specifically, to flexibly reconfigure the battery's\ndischarging/charging operations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based\nreconfiguring policy, which can adapt to the dynamical renewable energy\ngenerations as well as the varying power demands. Our experiments using the\nreal-world data on renewable energy generations and power demands demonstrate\nthat, our reconfigurable power supply solution can achieve an energy saving\nratio of 74.8%, compared to the case with traditional power grid supply.\n\nPublished: 2022-07-22\nTitle: Towards Low-carbon Power Networks: Optimal Integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Hydrogen Storage\nAuthors: Sezen Ece KayacÄ±k, Albert H.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels.

Bertilson\nSummary: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make\ndiagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an\nintuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.\nThese drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data\nand make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world\npatient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.\nNext, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model\n(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen\ndiscomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by\nusing mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results\nshow reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort\ndrawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM\ngiven a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The\npositive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be\nused for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support\nsystem for physicians and other health care personnel.\n\nPublished: 2024-02-01\nTitle: Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review\nAuthors: Qizhang Feng, Mengnan Du, Na Zou, Xia Hu\nSummary: The digitization of healthcare data coupled with advances in computational\ncapabilities has propelled the adoption of machine learning (ML) in healthcare.\nHowever, these methods can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing disparities,\nleading to fairness concerns such as the unequal distribution of resources and\ndiagnostic inaccuracies among different demographic groups. Addressing these\nfairness problem is paramount to prevent further entrenchment of social\ninjustices. In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine\nlearning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the\nprinciples of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two\ndistinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance. We provide a critical\nreview of the associated fairness metrics from a machine learning standpoint\nand examine biases and mitigation strategies across the stages of the ML\nlifecycle, discussing the relationship between biases and their\ncountermeasures. The paper concludes with a discussion on the pressing\nchallenges that remain unaddressed in ensuring fairness in healthcare ML, and\nproposes several new research directions that hold promise for developing\nethical and equitable ML applications in healthcare."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning.

Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)\nplays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme\nweather events.

We further find that the variability of the daily\nArctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming\nclimate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather\npatterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk\nto human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate\nclimate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and\nimplies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather\ninstabilities.

To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide.

R. Cadenhead, Payal Bal, Brendan A. Wintle\nSummary: Climate change threatens biodiversity directly by influencing biophysical\nvariables that drive species\' geographic distributions and indirectly through\nsocio-economic changes that influence land use patterns, driven by global\nconsumption, production and climate. To date, no detailed analyses have been\nproduced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these\ndirect and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales.\nHere, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative\ninfluence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian\nspecies in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated\nimpacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but\nglobal shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats\nworldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit\npredictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a\nconsistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy,\nregulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from\nsub-national to global.\n\nPublished: 2024-03-18\nTitle: ClimateQ&A: Bridging the gap between climate scientists and the general public\nAuthors: Natalia De La Calzada, ThÃ©o Alves Da Costa, Annabelle Blangero, Nicolas Chesneau\nSummary: This research paper investigates public views on climate change and\nbiodiversity loss by analyzing questions asked to the ClimateQ&A platform.\nClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based\non over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports.\nLaunched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions,\nmainly from a French audience.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

Loke\nSummary: The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least\nas far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied\naround two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and\nadvances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading\ntowards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts\nand ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well\nas look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development\nof the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum\nInternet computing.\n\nPublished: 2024-06-05\nTitle: Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges\nAuthors: Sukhpal Singh Gill, Oktay Cetinkaya, Stefano Marrone, Daniel Claudino, David Haunschild, Leon Schlote, Huaming Wu, Carlo Ottaviani, Xiaoyuan Liu, Sree Pragna Machupalli, Kamalpreet Kaur, Priyansh Arora, Ji Liu, Ahmed Farouk, Houbing Herbert Song, Steve Uhlig, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao\nSummary: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement,\nsuperposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial\nprocessing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few\nyears have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm\ncreation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the\nprospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have\ncomprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and\nfind outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research\ncommunity working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand\nquantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on\ncurrent research in this area.

Schrotenboer, Evrim Ursavas, Iris F. A. Vis\nSummary: This paper proposes a new optimization model and solution method for\ndetermining optimal locations and sizing of renewable energy sources and\nhydrogen storage in a power network. We obtain these strategic decisions based\non the multi-period alternating current optimal power (AC OPF) flow problem\nthat considers the uncertainty of renewable output, electricity demand, and\nelectricity prices. We develop a second-order cone programming approach within\na Benders decomposition framework to provide globally optimal solutions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a systematic\noptimization framework based on AC OPF that jointly analyzes power network,\nrenewable, and hydrogen storage interactions in order to provide optimal\nlocations and sizing decisions of renewables and hydrogen storage. In a test\ncase, we show that the joint integration of renewable sources and hydrogen\nstorage and consideration of the AC OPF model significantly reduces the\noperational cost of the power network. In turn, our findings can provide\nquantitative insights to decision-makers on how to integrate renewable sources\nand hydrogen storage under different settings of the hydrogen selling price,\nrenewable curtailment costs, emission tax prices, and conversion efficiency.\n\nPublished: 2023-10-22\nTitle: Optimal Workload Allocation for Distributed Edge Clouds With Renewable Energy and Battery Storage\nAuthors: Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Jiaming Cheng, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen\nSummary: This paper studies an optimal workload allocation problem for a network of\nrenewable energy-powered edge clouds that serve users located across various\ngeographical areas. Specifically, each edge cloud is furnished with both an\non-site renewable energy generation unit and a battery storage unit. Due to the\ndiscrepancy in electricity pricing and the diverse temporal-spatial\ncharacteristics of renewable energy generation, how to optimally allocate\nworkload to different edge clouds to minimize the total operating cost while\nmaximizing renewable energy utilization is a crucial and challenging problem.\nTo this end, we introduce and formulate an optimization-based framework\ndesigned for Edge Service Providers (ESPs) with the overarching goal of\nsimultaneously reducing energy costs and environmental impacts through the\nintegration of renewable energy sources and battery storage systems, all while\nmaintaining essential quality-of-service standards. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution in maintaining\nservice quality as well as reducing operational costs and emissions.\nFurthermore, the impacts of renewable energy generation and battery storage on\noptimal system operations are rigorously analyzed.\n\nPublished: 2019-09-24\nTitle: Profitable Emissions-Reducing Energy Storage\nAuthors: Daniel J. Olsen, Daniel S. Kirschen\nSummary: While energy arbitrage from energy storage can lower power system operating\ncosts, it can also increase greenhouse gas emissions. If power system\noperations are conducted with the constraint that energy storage operation must\nnot increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage\ninvestment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are\nconsidered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and\nprofit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed\nto obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.\n  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity\nanalyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless\nof the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more\nenergy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility.

Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini\nSummary: The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks,\ndata, and methods are summarized accordingly. To provide more insights into how\nto fight the COVID-19 pandemic and future global catastrophes, we further\ndiscuss challenges and potential opportunities."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "At step 2, you need to postprocess gathered information to fulfill the user's requrements.

A range of different measures have been implemented\nworldwide to reduce the rate of new infections and to manage the pressure on\nnational health services. A primary strategy has been to reduce gatherings and\nthe potential for transmission through the prioritisation of remote working and\neducation. Enhanced hand hygiene and the use of facial masks have decreased the\nspread of pathogens when gatherings are unavoidable. These particular measures\npresent challenges for reliable biometric recognition, e.g. for facial-, voice-\nand hand-based biometrics.

These quantum features help\nsolve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing\nmethods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics,\nchemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy,\nbanking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering.

The results suggest\nthat states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal\nfactors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and\nsimultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political\ncosts, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range\nof governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically\ndemocratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'\ndecisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably\nmore likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with\nhigher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic\nimpact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that\nmany states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.\n\nPublished: 2020-06-06\nTitle: When Wireless Communication Faces COVID-19: Combating the Pandemic and Saving the Economy\nAuthors: Nasir Saeed, Ahmed Bader, Tareq Y.

Countries across the world are using digital technologies to\nfight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,\nstrongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In\nthis paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19\npandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are\nhelping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,\nenabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and\nconferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the\npandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss\nthe challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and\nmisinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication\ntechnologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of\nindustries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at\nrisk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the\npandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.\n\nPublished: 2023-03-23\nTitle: Human Behavior in the Time of COVID-19: Learning from Big Data\nAuthors: Hanjia Lyu, Arsal Imtiaz, Yufei Zhao, Jiebo Luo\nSummary: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic in March 2020, there have been over 600 million confirmed cases of\nCOVID-19 and more than six million deaths as of October 2022. The relationship\nbetween the COVID-19 pandemic and human behavior is complicated. On one hand,\nhuman behavior is found to shape the spread of the disease. On the other hand,\nthe pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every\naspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between\nhuman behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big\ndata techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio\nsignal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this\nstudy, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data\ntechniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nparticular, we categorize these studies into three groups - using big data to\nmeasure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively.
