Quantum computers with a small number of qubits have been demonstrated to solve specific problems more efficiently than classical computers. Researchers have also made progress in developing new quantum algorithms, such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which can be used for solving complex optimization problems and simulating the behavior of molecules.\n\nIn addition, significant advances have been made in the development of quantum error correction techniques, such as surface codes and concatenated codes, which are essential for building large-scale reliable quantum computers.'}
