(2014)\n* "Variational Quantum Eigensolver for molecular systems" by Peruzzo et al. (2014)\n\nThese advancements have brought quantum computing closer to practical applications, with potential uses in fields such as chemistry, materials science, and machine learning.\n\nWould you like me to provide more information on any of these topics?'}
