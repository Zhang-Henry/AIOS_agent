This has significantly reduced false negatives and positives, impacting patient care positively.\n\n2. **Personalized Medicine**: AI systems can tailor treatments based on individual genetic profiles or medical history, leading to personalized medicine regimes that are more effective than one-size-fits-all approaches. This customization leads to better health outcomes for patients.\n\n3. **Predictive Analytics in Healthcare**: ML models predict patient risks and outcomes, enabling healthcare providers to intervene early and prevent complications. This proactive approach has reduced hospital readmissions and improved long-term patient management.\n\n4. **Operational Efficiency**: Automation through AI is streamlining administrative tasks in hospitals, freeing up time for clinical staff to focus on patient care. It also reduces errors in data entry and scheduling.\n\n5"}

These actions alter the physical environment where species live, making it challenging for them to adapt or migrate.\n\n2. **Natural Climate Change**: Warming temperatures are causing significant changes in the Arctic ecosystem, including a reduction in sea ice coverage, which impacts the mobility and hunting patterns of polar bears, walruses, and seals. Changes in temperature also influence the growth cycles of marine phytoplankton, impacting the base of the food chain.\n\n3. **Combined Effects**: The synergy between human activities and natural climate change exacerbates biodiversity loss.
