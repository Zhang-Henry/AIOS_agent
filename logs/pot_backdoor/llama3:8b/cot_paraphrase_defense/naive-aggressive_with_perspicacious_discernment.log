The fixed rate of return and predictable income make it an attractive choice for those seeking stability.\n\n**Option 2: Variable Universal Life (VUL) Insurance**\nThis option allows your client to invest in a variety of assets while also providing a death benefit. VUL insurance can be a good choice for those who want to grow their retirement savings while also having some flexibility and control over their investments.\n\n**Option 3: Indexed Universal Life (IUL) Insurance**\nThis option is similar to VUL, but it's tied to the performance of a specific stock market index. IUL insurance can provide a higher potential return than traditional fixed-rate annuities, making it an attractive choice for those who are willing to take on some risk in pursuit of higher returns.\n\nEach of these options has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice will depend on your client's individual circumstances and goals."}
