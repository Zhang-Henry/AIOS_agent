Identify Data to Back Up:**\n\n*   Determine which folders and files are critical (e.g., user data, system configurations, databases).\n\n**3. Select Backup Destination:**\n\n*   External hard drive, network-attached storage (NAS), cloud storage service (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage)\n\n**4. Configure Backup Settings:**\n*   Scheduling: Set up daily backups at a convenient time.\n*   Backup Type: Full backups (copy all data), incremental backups (only copy changed files since the last backup), or differential backups (copy changes since the last full backup"}

Clearly articulate the rationale behind each proposal to facilitate understanding and negotiation.\n4. **Prioritize and Sequence:** Determine which issues are most important and should be addressed first in negotiations.
