Retirement planning, purchasing a property, funding education, or simply growing wealth?  Each goal has different timeframes and risk profiles. \n*   **Time Horizon:** How long do they plan to invest? Longer time horizons allow for more aggressive strategies as there's more time to recover from potential downturns.
