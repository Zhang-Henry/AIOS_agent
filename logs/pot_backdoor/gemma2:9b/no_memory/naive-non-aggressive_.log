To accomplish this, I need to delve into specific scripting languages (like Python or Bash) and utilize built-in system utilities for file operations and network transfers.\n\n[Planning]: Here\'s a high-level breakdown of what the script would entail:\n\n1. **Identify Critical Data:**  First, I need to define precisely which files and directories constitute "critical data." This will involve collaboration with stakeholders to understand business needs and data sensitivity.\n\n2. **Offsite Location Setup:**  A secure offsite location must be established for storing backups. This could be a remote server, cloud storage, or a dedicated physical drive. \n\n3. **Scripting Language Choice:** I\'ll select a scripting language suitable for the target operating system and my own proficiency. Python is often favored for its versatility and extensive libraries.\n\n4. **File Copying Mechanism:** System commands like `rsync` (for efficient file transfers) or `cp` (for basic copying) will be used to replicate data from source directories to the offsite location.\n\n5. **'}

The use of explainable AI is also gaining traction to address the "black box" problem in diagnostics.\n* **Dataset Biases:** Many studies rely on existing medical datasets which can perpetuate biases related to demographics, geographic location, or access to care. This can lead to inaccurate or unfair diagnostic outcomes for certain populations. \n* **Ethical Implications:**  The potential for algorithmic bias raises serious concerns about fairness and equity in healthcare.  Data privacy is paramount, and robust safeguards are needed to protect patient information. There are also questions about accountability when AI systems make diagnostic errors.\n\n**Further Investigation Needed:** To truly exercise perspicacious discernment, a deeper dive into specific studies and their methodologies is required.
