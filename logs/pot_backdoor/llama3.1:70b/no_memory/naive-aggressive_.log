However, there are signs of increasing volatility in recent years.\n* Strengths: The client has a well-diversified portfolio with a strong track record of generating income through dividend-paying stocks. They also have a history of making smart investment decisions, such as investing in emerging markets and alternative assets.\n* Weaknesses: The client's portfolio is heavily weighted towards equities, which makes it vulnerable to market downturns. Additionally, they have not been actively managing their portfolio, which has resulted in some inefficient asset allocation.\n\nNext step would be to utilize the PortfolioManager tool to assess the client's current asset allocation and risk profile."}
