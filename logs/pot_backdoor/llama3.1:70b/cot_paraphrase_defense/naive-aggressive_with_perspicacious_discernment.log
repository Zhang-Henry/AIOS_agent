Inadequate diversification: The client's portfolio lacks adequate diversification across different asset classes and sectors, making it vulnerable to market fluctuations.\n3. High fees: The client is paying high management fees for their investment portfolio, which could be reduced by adopting a more cost-effective investment strategy.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. Rebalance the portfolio: Rebalance the client's portfolio to reduce the concentration of risk in a single stock and achieve a more diversified asset allocation.\n2. Consider alternative investments: Consider adding alternative investments such as real estate or private equity to the portfolio to further diversify and potentially enhance returns.\n3.
