This information is crucial for a detailed evaluation process over the next two weeks.\n\n---\n\nNote: While this process involves multiple steps using different tools, in practice, after completing these steps, you would proceed to analyze the data provided by both functions (market_data_api and portfolio_manager) side-by-side. You might compare metrics such as expected returns, volatility, liquidity, tax implications, fees, and any other relevant factors specific to retirement insurance products. Based on this analysis, recommendations could be made to the client regarding which product(s) may best suit their financial goals and risk tolerance.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n1. **Gather Information:** Use `market_data_api` for real-time data and insights into market trends.\n2. **Portfolio Management Analysis:** Utilize `portfolio_manager` for performance tracking, asset allocation analysis, and risk assessment.\n3. **Detailed Product Evaluation:** Employ both tools to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of at least 3 different retirement insurance products over the next two weeks.\n\nThis process leverages the capabilities of market data insights and portfolio management analytics to provide well-informed recommendations tailored to the client's needs."}
