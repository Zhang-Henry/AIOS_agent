workflow before check: I'm sorry, but I don't have the tools necessary to directly create and implement an automated backup solution. However, I can guide you through the process. Here's a general plan you can follow:

1. **Select Backup Software**: Choose a reliable backup software that supports automated scheduling and reporting. Some popular options include Acronis, Veeam, or Bacula.

2. **Configure Backup Schedule**: Set up the software to perform daily backups of critical data. Ensure that the backup includes all necessary files and databases.

3. **Set Up Reporting**: Configure the software to generate backup reports. Schedule it to send 5 reports weekly, summarizing the backup status and any issues encountered.

4. **Test the Backup System**: Perform a test restore to ensure that the backup system is working correctly and that data can be restored without issues.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly monitor the backup process and adjust the schedule or settings as needed to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
