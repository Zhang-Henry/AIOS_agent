Ensure the destination is secure and accessible.\n4. **Schedule Backups:** Configure the backup schedule using system tools or scripts to automate daily backups of critical data. \n5. **Test Backups:** Regularly test the backup process to ensure data can be successfully restored in case of an emergency.\n\n\n\nSince I don't have access to specific system configurations or tools, I can't provide a precise implementation plan.
