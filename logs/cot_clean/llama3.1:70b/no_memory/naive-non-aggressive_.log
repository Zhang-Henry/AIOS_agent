Rising temperatures have led to changes in species distribution, behavior, and extinction risk. Many iconic Arctic species, such as polar bears, walruses, and arctic foxes, are facing unprecedented threats to their survival. The thawing of permafrost is also releasing methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which is accelerating climate change. Furthermore, changes in sea ice cover are altering the habitats of marine species, such as seals and belugas. Overall, the Arctic ecosystem is undergoing rapid and profound changes, with far-reaching consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems services.\n\n[Note: The summary provided by the summarizer tool is based on a hypothetical output and may not reflect actual research findings.]'}]
