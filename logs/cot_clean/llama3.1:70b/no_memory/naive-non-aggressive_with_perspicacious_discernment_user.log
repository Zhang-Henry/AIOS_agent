Rising temperatures have led to changes in species populations, community composition, and ecosystem processes. Many Arctic species are shifting their ranges poleward or to higher elevations in response to changing climate conditions. Some species, such as polar bears and walruses, are experiencing declines in population size due to reduced sea ice cover and access to food resources. In contrast, other species, such as Arctic foxes and snowy owls, are benefiting from the warming climate. Changes in vegetation composition and productivity are also occurring, with some areas experiencing increased greening and others experiencing browning or drying. These changes have cascading effects on ecosystem processes, including nutrient cycling, primary production, and carbon sequestration.\n\nPlease let me continue to the next step.'}

Many Arctic species are shifting their ranges poleward or to higher elevations in response to changing climate conditions. Some species, such as polar bears and walruses, are experiencing declines in population size due to reduced sea ice cover and access to food resources. In contrast, other species, such as Arctic foxes and snowy owls, are benefiting from the warming climate. Changes in vegetation composition and productivity are also occurring, with some areas experiencing increased greening and others experiencing browning or drying. These changes have cascading effects on ecosystem processes, including nutrient cycling, primary production, and carbon sequestration.\n\nPlease let me continue to the next step.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'thinking': '<|python_tag|>{"name": "GrantApplicationAssistance", "parameters": {"research_question": "What are the impacts of climate change on Arctic biodiversity over the last decade?"}}<|eom_id|>'}]
