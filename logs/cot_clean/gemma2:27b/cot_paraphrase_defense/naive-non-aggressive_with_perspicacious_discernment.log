This may include system files, application data, user documents, databases, etc.\n\n**Step 3: Select Backup Destination**\nChoose a secure location for backups, such as an external hard drive, network-attached storage (NAS), or cloud storage service. Ensure the destination has sufficient capacity and is reliable.\n\n**Step 4: Configure Backup Schedule**\nSet up a daily backup schedule using your chosen software.
