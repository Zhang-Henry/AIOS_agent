Here are some specific recommendations: 1) Increase exposure in technology stocks as they have shown strong growth potential over the past decade; 2) Consider adding more bonds to balance out equity risks; 3) Look into emerging market funds which can offer higher yields compared to developed markets but also come with increased volatility. Remember these strategies should be tailored according to individual financial goals and tolerance for risk. It's important to periodically review your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your investment objectives over time.

Although they have achieved higher returns, they also face greater volatility and potential risks. In addition, due to the lack of allocation in low-risk fixed-income products, once the stock market or real estate market fluctuates greatly, the overall investment portfolio will be subject to greater impact. Therefore, it is recommended that the client adjust the asset allocation strategy reasonably, appropriately reduce the proportion of stocks and real estate, increase the proportion of bonds and other fixed-income financial products, so as to achieve a more balanced risk and return ratio."}
